<h2><!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>Again<span class="smcap">, </span>on behalf of readers of this <span class="smcap">National
Library, </span>I have to thank a poet of our day&mdash;in this case
the Oxford Professor of Poetry&mdash;for joining his voice to the voices
of the past through which our better life is quickened for the duties
of to-day.&nbsp; Not for his own verse only, but for his fine sense
also of what is truest in the poets who have gone before, the name of
Francis Turner Palgrave is familiar to us all.&nbsp; Many a home has
been made the richer for his gathering of voices of the past into a
dainty &ldquo;Golden Treasury of English Songs.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of this
work of his own I may cite what was said of it in <i>Macmillan&rsquo;s
Magazine</i> for October, 1882, by a writer of high authority in English
Literature, Professor A. W. Ward, of Owens College.&nbsp; &ldquo;A very
eminent authority,&rdquo; said Professor Ward, &ldquo;has accorded to
Mr. Palgrave&rsquo;s historical insight, praise by the side of which
all words of mine must be valueless,&rdquo; Canon [now Bishop] Stubbs
writes:&mdash;&ldquo;I do not think that there is one of the <i>Visions</i>
which does not carry my thorough consent and sympathy all through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, then, Mr. Palgrave re-issues, for the help of many thousands
more, his own songs of the memories of the Nation, addressed to a Nation
that has not yet forfeited the praise of Milton.&nbsp; Milton said of
the Englishman, &ldquo;If we look at his native towardliness in the
roughcast, without breeding, some nation or <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>other
may haply be better composed to a natural civility and right judgment
than he.&nbsp; But if he get the benefit once of a wise and well-rectified
nurture, I suppose that wherever mention is made of countries, manners,
or men, the English people, among the first that shall be praised, may
deserve to be accounted a right pious, right honest, and right hardy
nation.&rdquo;&nbsp; So much is shown by the various utterances in this
<span class="smcap">National Library.&nbsp; S</span>o much is shown,
in the present volume of it, by a poet&rsquo;s vision of the England
that has been till now, and is what she has been.</p>

<h2><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p>As the scheme which the Author has here endeavoured to execute has
not, so far as he knows, the advantage of any near precedent in any
literature, he hopes that a few explanatory words may be offered without
incurring censure for egotism.</p>
<p>Our history is so eminently rich and varied, and at the same time,
by the fact of our insular position, so stamped with unity, that from
days very remote it has supplied matter for song.&nbsp; This, among
Celts and Angles, at first was lyrical.&nbsp; But poetry, for many centuries
after the Conquest, mainly took the annalistic form, and, despite the
ability often shown, was hence predoomed to failure.&nbsp; For a nation&rsquo;s
history cannot but present many dull or confused periods, many men and
things intractable by poetry, though, perhaps, politically effective
and important, which cannot be excluded from any narrative aiming at
consecutiveness; and, by the natural laws of art, these passages, when
rendered in verse, in their effect become more prosaic than they would
be in a prose rendering.</p>
<p>My attempt has therefore been to revert to the earlier and more natural
conditions of poetry, and to offer,&mdash;not a continuous narrative;
not poems on every critical moment or conspicuous man in our long annals,&mdash;but
single lyrical pictures of such leading or typical characters and scenes
in English history, and only such, as have seemed amenable to a strictly
poetical treatment.&nbsp; Poetry, not History, has, hence, been my first
and last aim; or, perhaps I might define it, History for Poetry&rsquo;s
sake.&nbsp; At the same time, I have striven to keep throughout as closely
to absolute <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>historical
truth in the design and colouring of the pieces as the exigencies of
poetry permit:&mdash;the result aimed at being to unite the actual tone
and spirit of the time concerned, with the best estimate which has been
reached by the research and genius of modern investigators.&nbsp; Our
island story, freed from the &lsquo;falsehood of extremes,&rsquo;&mdash;exorcised,
above all, from the seducing demon of party-spirit, I have thus here
done my best to set forth.&nbsp; And as this line of endeavour has conducted
and constrained me, especially when the seventeenth century is concerned,
to judgments&mdash;supported indeed by historians conspicuous for research,
ability, and fairness, but often remote from the views popularized by
the writers of our own day,&mdash;upon these points a few justificatory
notes have been added.</p>
<p>A double aim has hence governed and limited both the selection and
the treatment of my subjects.&nbsp; The choice has necessarily fallen,
often, not on simply picturesque incident or unfamiliar character, but
on the men and things that we think of first, when thinking of the long
chronicle of England,&mdash;or upon such as represent and symbolize
the main current of it.&nbsp; Themes, however, on which able or popular
song is already extant,&mdash;notably in case of Scotland,&mdash;I have
in general avoided.&nbsp; In the rendering, my desire has been always
to rest the poetry of each Vision on its own intrinsic interest; to
write with a straightforward eye to the object alone; not studious of
ornament for ornament&rsquo;s sake; allowing the least possible overt
intrusion of the writer&rsquo;s personality; and, in accordance with
lyrical law, seeking, as a rule, to fix upon some factual picture for
each poem.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>To define, thus, the scope of what this book attempts, is, in itself,
a confession of presumptuousness,&mdash;the writer&rsquo;s own sense
of which is but feebly and imperfectly expressed in the words from Vergil&rsquo;s
letter to Augustus prefixed as my motto.&nbsp; In truth, so rich and
so wide are the materials, <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>that
to scheme a lyrical series which should really paint the <i>Gesta Anglorum</i>
in their fulness might almost argue &lsquo;lack of wit,&rsquo; <i>vitium
mentis</i>, in much greater powers than mine.&nbsp; No criticism, however
severe, can add to my own consciousness how far the execution of the
work, in regard to each of its aims, falls below the plan.&nbsp; Yet
I would allow myself the hope, great as the deficiencies may be, that
the love of truth and the love of England are mine by inheritance in
a degree sufficient to exempt this book, (the labour of several years),
from infidelity to either:&mdash;that the intrinsic worth and weight
of my subject may commend these songs, both at home, and in the many
Englands beyond sea, to those who, (despite the inevitably more engrossing
attractions of the Present, and the emphatic bias of modern culture
towards the immediate and the tangible), maintain that high and soul-inspiring
interest which, identifying us with our magnificent Past, and all its
varied lessons of defeat and victory, offers at the same time,&mdash;under
the guidance from above,&mdash;our sole secure guarantee for prosperous
and healthy progress in the Future.</p>
<blockquote><p>The world has cycles in its course, when all<br />
That once has been, is acted o&rsquo;er again;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and only the nation which, at each moment of political or social
evolution, looks lovingly backward to its own painfully-earned experience&mdash;<i>Respiciens</i>,
<i>Prospiciens</i>, as Tennyson&rsquo;s own chosen device expresses
it&mdash;has solid reason to hope, that its movement is true Advance&mdash;that
its course is Upward.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>It remains only to add, that the book has been carefully revised
and corrected, and that nineteen pieces published in the original volume
of 1881 are not reprinted in the present issue.</p>

<h3>PRELUDE</h3>
<p><i>CAESAR TO EGBERT</i></p>
<p>1</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;England<span class="smcap">, </span>fair England!&nbsp;
Empress isle of isles!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;Round whom the loving-envious ocean plays,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Girdling thy feet with silver and with smiles,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst all the nations crowd thy liberal bays;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With rushing wheel and heart of fire they come,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or glide and glance like white-wing&rsquo;d doves that
know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And seek their proper home:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; England! not England yet! but fair as now,<br />
When first the chalky strand was stirr&rsquo;d by Roman prow.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On thy dear countenance, great mother-land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Age after age thy sons have set their sign,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Moulding the features with successive hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not always sedulous of beauty&rsquo;s line:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet here Man&rsquo;s art in one harmonious aim<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With Nature&rsquo;s gentle moulding, oft has work&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The perfect whole to frame:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor does earth&rsquo;s labour&rsquo;d face elsewhere, like
thee,<br />
Give back her children&rsquo;s heart with such full sympathy</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;On marshland rough and self-sprung forest
gazed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The imperial Roman of the eagle-eye;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Log-splinter&rsquo;d forts on green hill-summits raised,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>Earth
huts and rings that dot the chalk-downs high:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dark rites of hidden faith in grove and moor;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Idols of monstrous build; wheel&rsquo;d scythes of war;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rock tombs and pillars hoar:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Strange races, Finn, Iberian, Belgae, Celt;<br />
While in the wolds huge bulls and antler&rsquo;d giants dwelt.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Another age!&mdash;The spell of Rome has
past<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Transforming all our Britain; Ruthless plough,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which plough&rsquo;d the world, yet o&rsquo;er the nations
cast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The seed of arts, and law, and all that now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has ripen&rsquo;d into commonwealths:&mdash;Her hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With network mile-paths binding plain and hill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arterialized the land:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The thicket yields: the soil for use is clear;<br />
Peace with her plastic touch,&mdash;field, farm, and grange are here.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo, flintwall&rsquo;d cities, castles stark and
square<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bastion&rsquo;d with rocks that rival Nature&rsquo;s own;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Red-furnaced baths, trim gardens planted fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With tree and flower the North ne&rsquo;er yet had known;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Long temple-roofs and statues poised on high<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With golden wings outstretch&rsquo;d for tiptoe flight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quivering in summer sky:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The land had rest, while those stern legions lay<br />
By northern ramparts camp&rsquo;d, and held the Pict at bay.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperious Empire!&nbsp; Thrice-majestic Rome!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No later age, as earth&rsquo;s slow centuries glide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can raze the footprints stamp&rsquo;d where thou hast come,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The ne&rsquo;er-repeated grandeur of thy stride!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;Though now so dense a darkness takes the land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Law, peace, wealth, letters, faith,&mdash;all lights are
quench&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>By
violent heathen hand:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Vague warrior kings; names writ in fire and wrong;<br />
Aurelius, Urien, Ida;&mdash;shades of ancient song.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Thou&mdash;O whether born of flame and wave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or Gorlois&rsquo; son, or Uther&rsquo;s, blameless lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; True knight, who died for those thou couldst not save<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Round Table brake their plighted word,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lord of song hath set thee in thy grace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And glory, rescued from the phantom world,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before us face to face;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No more Avilion bowers the King detain;<br />
The mystic child returns; the Arthur reigns again!</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Now, as some cloud that hides a mountain
bulk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thins to white smoke, and mounts in lighten&rsquo;d air,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And through the veil the gray enormous hulk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Burns, and the summit, last, is keen and bare,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From wasted Britain so the gloaming clears;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Another birth of time breaks eager out,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And England fair appears:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Imperial youth sign&rsquo;d on her golden brow,<br />
While the prophetic eyes with hope and promise glow.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from the wasted places of the land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Charr&rsquo;d skeletons of cities, circling walls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Roman might, and towers that shatter&rsquo;d stand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of that lost world survivors, forth she calls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her new creation:&mdash;O&rsquo;er the land is wrought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The happy villagedom by English tribes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From Elbe and Baltic brought;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Red kine light up with life the ravaged plain;<br />
The forest glooms are pierced; the plough-land laughs again.</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>10</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each from its little croft the homesteads peep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Green apple-garths around, and hedgeless meads,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Smooth-shaven lawns of ever-shifting sheep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wolds where his dappled crew the swineherd feeds:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pale gold round pure pale foreheads, and their eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; More dewy blue than speedwell by the brook<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Spring&rsquo;s fresh current flies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The free fair maids come barefoot to the fount,<br />
Or poppy-crown&rsquo;d with fire, the car of harvest mount.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the salt stream that rings us, ness and bay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The nation&rsquo;s old sea-soul beats blithe and strong;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The black foam-breasters taste Biscayan spray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And where &rsquo;neath Polar dawns the narwhals throng:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Free hands, free hearts, for labour and for glee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or village-moot, when thane with churl unites<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath the sacred tree;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While wisdom tempers force, and bravery leads,<br />
Till spears beat <i>Aye</i>! on shields, and words at once are deeds.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again with life the ruin&rsquo;d cities smile,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Again from mother-Rome their sacred fire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowledge and Faith rekindle through the isle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nigh quench&rsquo;d by barbarous war and heathen ire:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;No more on Balder&rsquo;s grave let Anglia weep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When winter storms entomb the golden year<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunk in Adonis-sleep;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Another God has risen, and not in vain!<br />
The Woden-ash is low, the Cross asserts her reign.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Land of the most law-loving,&mdash;the most
free!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My dear, dear England! sweet and green as now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>The
flower-illumined garden of the sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Nature least impair&rsquo;d by axe and plough!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A laughing land!&mdash;Thou seest not in the north<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How the black Dane and vulture Norseman wait<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sign of coming forth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The foul Landeyda flap its raven plume,<br />
And all the realms once more eclipsed in pagan gloom!</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;O race, of many races well compact!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As some rich stream that runs in silver down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the White Mount:&mdash;his baby steps untrack&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where clouds and emerald cliffs of crystal frown;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, alien founts bring tributary flood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or kindred waters blend their native hue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some darkening as with blood;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These fraught with iron strength and freshening brine,<br />
And these with lustral waves, to sweeten and refine.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now calm as strong, and clear as summer air,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Blessing and blest of earth and sky, he glides:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now on some rock-ridge rends his bosom fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And foams with cloudy wrath and hissing tides:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then with full flood of level-gliding force,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His discord-blended melody murmurs low<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down the long seaward course:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So through Time&rsquo;s mead, great River, greatly glide:<br />
Whither, thou may&rsquo;st not know:&mdash;but He, who knows, will guide.</p>
<p>St. 3 Sketches Prehistoric England.&nbsp; St. 4 <i>Mile-paths</i>;
old English name for Roman roads.&nbsp; St. 5 <i>Tree and flower</i>;
such are reported to have been naturalized in England by the Romans.&mdash;<i>Northern
ramparts</i>; that of Agricola and Lollius Urbicus from Forth to Clyde,
and the greater work of Hadrian and Severus between Tyne and Solway.&nbsp;
St. 6, 7 The Arthurian legends,&mdash;now revivified for us by Tennyson&rsquo;s
<!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>magnificent
<i>Idylls of the King</i>,&mdash;form the visionary links in our history
between the decline of the Roman power and the earlier days of the Saxon
conquest.&nbsp; St. 9 <i>Villagedom</i>; Angles and Saxons seem at first
to have burned the larger towns of the Romanized Britons and left them
deserted, in favour of village-life.&nbsp; St. 11 <i>Village-moot</i>:
Held on a little hill or round a sacred tree: &lsquo;the ealdermen spoke,
groups of freemen stood round, clashing shields in applause, settling
matters by loud shouts of <i>Aye</i> or <i>Nay</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; (J.
R. Green, <i>History of the English People</i>).&nbsp; St. 12 Balder,
the God of Light, like Adonis in the old Greek story, is a nature-myth,
figuring the Sun, yearly dying in winter, and yearly restored to life.&nbsp;
St. 13 <i>Landeyda</i>; Name of Danish banner: &lsquo;the desolation
of the land.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For further details upon points briefly noticed in this <i>Prelude</i>,
readers are referred to Mr. J. R. Green&rsquo;s <i>History</i>, and
to Mr. T. Wright&rsquo;s <i>The Celt</i>, <i>The Roman</i>, and <i>The
Saxon</i>, as sources readily accessible.</p>

Ocean sends up a deep, deep undertone,</p>
<p>As though his heavy chariot-wheels went round:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor is there other sound<br />
Save from the abyss of air, a plaintive note,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The seabirds&rsquo; calling cry,<br />
As &rsquo;gainst the wind with well-poised weight they float,</p>
<p>Or on some white-fringed reef set up their post,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sentinel the coast:&mdash;<br />
Whilst, round each jutting cape, in pillar&rsquo;d file,<br />

Star-steer&rsquo;d adventurous from the Iberic shore</p>
<p>Or the Sidonian, with their fragrant freight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oil-olive, fig, and date;<br />
Jars of dark sunburnt wine, flax-woven robes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or Tyrian azure glass<br />
Wavy with gold, and agate-banded globes:&mdash;</p>
<p>Changing for amber-knobs their Eastern ware<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or tin-sand silvery fair,<br />
To temper brazen swords, or rim the shield<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of heroes, arm&rsquo;d for fight:&mdash;<br />
While the rough miners, wondering, gladly yield</p>
<p>The treasured ore; nor Alexander&rsquo;s name<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Know, nor fair Helen&rsquo;s shame;<br />
Or in his tent how Peleus&rsquo; wrathful son<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Looks toward the sea, nor heeds<br />
The towers of still-unconquer&rsquo;d Ilion.</p>
<p><i>Belerium</i>; The name given to the Land&rsquo;s End by Diodorus,
the Greek historical compiler.&nbsp; He describes the natives as hospitable
and civilized.&nbsp; They mined tin, which was bought by traders and
carried through Gaul to the south-east, and may, as suggested here,
have been used in their armour by the warriors during the Homeric Siege
of Troy.</p>

AND EDWIN</h3>
<p>627</p>
<p>The black-hair&rsquo;d gaunt Paulinus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By ruddy Edwin stood:&mdash;<br />
&lsquo;Bow down, O King of Deira,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the holy Rood!<br />
Cast forth thy demon idols,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And worship Christ our Lord!&rsquo;<br />
&mdash;But Edwin look&rsquo;d and ponder&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And answer&rsquo;d not a word.</p>
<p>Again the gaunt Paulinus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To ruddy Edwin spake:<br />
&lsquo;God offers life immortal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For His dear Son&rsquo;s own sake!<br />
Wilt thou not hear his message<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who bears the Keys and Sword?&rsquo;<br />
&mdash;But Edwin look&rsquo;d and ponder&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And answer&rsquo;d not a word.</p>
<p>Rose then a sage old warrior;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was five-score winters old;<br />
Whose beard from chin to girdle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like one long snow-wreath roll&rsquo;d:&mdash;<br />
&lsquo;At Yule-time in our chamber<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We sit in warmth and light,<br />
While cavern-black around us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lies the grim mouth of Night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Athwart the room a sparrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Darts from the open door:<br />
Within the happy hearth-light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One red flash,&mdash;and no more!<br />
<!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>We
see it born from darkness,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And into darkness go:&mdash;<br />
So is our life, King Edwin!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, that it should be so!</p>
<p>&lsquo;But if this pale Paulinus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have somewhat more to tell;<br />
Some news of whence and whither,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And where the Soul may dwell:&mdash;<br />
If on that outer darkness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun of Hope may shine;&mdash;<br />
He makes life worth the living!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I take his God for mine!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So spake the wise old warrior;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all about him cried<br />
&lsquo;Paulinus&rsquo; God hath conquer&rsquo;d!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he shall he our guide:&mdash;<br />
For he makes life worth living,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who brings this message plain,&mdash;<br />
When our brief days are over,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That we shall live again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Paulinus was one of the four missionaries sent form Rome by Gregory
the Great in 601.&nbsp; The marriage of Edwin, King of Northumbria,
with Ethelburga, sister to Eadbald of Kent, opened Paulinus&rsquo; way
to northern England.&nbsp; Bede, born less than fifty years after, has
given an admirable narrative of Edwin&rsquo;s conversion: which is very
completely told in Bright&rsquo;s <i>Early English Church History</i>,
B. IV.</p>
<p>Deira, (from old-Welsh <i>deifr</i>, waters), then comprised Eastern
Yorkshire from Tees to Humber.&nbsp; Goodmanham, where the meeting described
was held, is some 23 miles from York.</p>

<h3>HASTINGS</h3>
<p>October 14: 1066</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gyrth<span class="smcap">, </span>is it dawn in the sky that
I see? or is all the sky blood?<br />
Heavy and sore was the fight in the North: yet we fought for the good.<br />
O but&mdash;Brother &rsquo;gainst brother!&mdash;&rsquo;twas hard!&mdash;Now
I come with a will<br />
To baste the false bastard of France, the hide of the tanyard and mill!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now on the razor-edge lies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; England the priceless, the prize!<br />
God aiding, the Raven at Stamford we smote;<br />
One stroke more for the land here I strike and devote!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Red with fresh breath on her lips came the dawn; and Harold uprose;<br />
Kneels as man before God; then takes his long pole-axe, and goes<br />
Where round their woven wall, tough ash-palisado, they crowd;<br />
Mightily cleaves and binds, to his comrades crying aloud<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>&lsquo;Englishmen
stalwart and true,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But one word has Harold for you!<br />
When from the field the false foreigners run,<br />
Stand firm in your castle, and all will be won!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, with God o&rsquo;er us, and Holy Rood, arm!&rsquo;&mdash;And
he ran for his spear:<br />
But Gyrth held him back, &rsquo;mong his brothers Gyrth the most honour&rsquo;d,
most dear:<br />
&lsquo;Go not, Harold! thine oath is against thee! the Saints look askance:<br />
I am not king; let me lead them, me only: mine be the chance!&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;&lsquo;No!&nbsp; The leader must lead!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Better that Harold should bleed!<br />
To the souls I appeal, not the dust of the tomb:&mdash;<br />
King chosen of Edward and England, I come!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Over Heathland surge banners and lances, three armies; William the
last,<br />
Clenching his mace; Rome&rsquo;s gonfanon round him Rome&rsquo;s majesty
cast:<br />
O&rsquo;er his Bretons Fergant, o&rsquo;er the hireling squadrons Montgomery
lords,<br />
Jerkin&rsquo;d archers, and mail-clads, and horsemen with pennons and
swords:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;England, in threefold array,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Anchor, and hold them at bay,<br />
Firm set in your own wooden walls! and the wave<br />
Of high-crested Frenchmen will break on their grave.</p>
<p>So to the palisade on!&nbsp; There, Harold and Leofwine and Gyrth<br />
Stand like a triple Thor, true brethren in arms as in birth:<br />
And above the fierce standards strain at their poles as they flare on
the gale;<br />
<!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>One,
the old Dragon of Wessex, and one, a Warrior in mail.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;God Almighty!&rsquo; they cry!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Haro!&rsquo; the Northmen reply:&mdash;<br />
As when eagles are gather&rsquo;d and loud o&rsquo;er the prey,<br />
Shout! for &rsquo;tis England the prize of the fray!</p>
<p>And as when two lightning-clouds tilt, between them an arrowy sleet<br />
Hisses and darts; till the challenging thunders are heard, and they
meet;<br />
Across fly javelins and serpents of flame: green earth and blue sky<br />
Blurr&rsquo;d in the blind tornado:&mdash;so now the battle goes high.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shearing through helmet and limb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Glaive-steel and battle-axe grim:<br />
As the flash of the reaper in summer&rsquo;s high wheat,<br />
King Harold mows horseman and horse at his feet.</p>
<p>O vainly the whirlwind of France up the turf to the palisade swept:<br />
Shoulder to shoulder the Englishmen stand, and the shield-wall is kept:&mdash;<br />
As, in a summer to be, when England and she yet again<br />
Strove for the sovranty, firm stood our squares, through the pitiless
rain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Death rain&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er them all day;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;Happier, not braver than they<br />
Who on Senlac e&rsquo;en yet their still garrison keep,<br />
Sleeping a long Marathonian sleep!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madmen, why turn?&rsquo; cried the Duke,&mdash;for the horsemen
recoil from the slope;<br />
&lsquo;Behold me!&nbsp; I live!&rsquo;&mdash;and he lifted the ventayle;
&lsquo;before you is hope:<br />
Death, not safety, behind!&rsquo;&mdash;and he spurs to the centre once
more,<br />
<!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Lion-like
leaps on the standard and Harold: but Gyrth is before!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Down!&nbsp; He is down!&rsquo; is the shout:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;On with the axes!&nbsp; Out, Out!&rsquo;<br />
&mdash;He rises again; the mace circles its stroke;<br />
Then falls as the thunderbolt falls on the oak.</p>
<p>&mdash;Gyrth is crush&rsquo;d, and Leofwine is crush&rsquo;d; yet
the shields hold their wall:<br />
&lsquo;Edith alone of my dear ones is left me, and dearest of all!<br />
Edith has said she would seek me to-day when the battle is done;<br />
Her love more precious alone than kingdoms and victory won;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O for the sweetness of home!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O for the kindness to come!&rsquo;<br />
Then around him again the wild war-dragons roar,<br />
And he drinks the red wine-cup of battle once more.</p>
<p>&mdash;&lsquo;Anyhow from their rampart to lure them, to shatter
the bucklers and wall,<br />
Acting a flight,&rsquo; in his craft thought William, and sign&rsquo;d
to recall<br />
His left battle:&mdash;O countrymen! slow to be roused! roused, always,
as then,<br />
Reckless of life or death, bent only to quit you like men!&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As bolts from the bow-string they go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whirl them and hurl them below,<br />
Where the deep foss yawns for the foe in his course,<br />
Piled up and brimming with horseman and horse.</p>
<p>As when October&rsquo;s sun, long caught in a curtain of gray,<br />
With a flood of impatient crimson breaks out, at the dying of day,<br />
And trees and green fields, the hills and the skies, are all steep&rsquo;d
in the stain;&mdash;<br />
<!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>So
o&rsquo;er the English one hope flamed forth, one moment,&mdash;in vain!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As hail when the corn-fields are deep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Down the fierce arrow-points sweep:<br />
Now the basnets of France o&rsquo;er the palisade frown;<br />
The shield-fort is shatter&rsquo;d; the Dragon is down.</p>
<p>O then there was dashing and dinting of axe and of broad-sword and
spear:<br />
Blood crying out to blood: and Hatred that casteth out fear!<br />
Loud where the fight is the loudest, the slaughter-breath hot in the
air,<br />
O what a cry was that!&mdash;the cry of a nation&rsquo;s despair!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;Hew down the best of the land!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Down them with mace and with brand!<br />
The fell foreign arrow has crash&rsquo;d to the brain;<br />
England with Harold the Englishman slain!</p>
<p>Yet they fought on for their England! of ineffaceable fame<br />
Worthy, and stood to the death, though the greedy sword, like a flame,<br />
Bit and bit yet again in the solid ranks, and the dead<br />
Heap where they die, and hills of foemen about them are spread:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;Hew down the heart of the land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There, to a man, where they stand!<br />
Till night with her blackness uncrimsons the stain,<br />
And the merciful shroud overshadows our slain.</p>
<p>Heroes unburied, unwept!&mdash;But a wan gray thing in the night<br />
Like a marsh-wisp flits to and fro through the blood-lake, the steam
of the fight;<br />
Turning the bodies, exploring the features with delicate touch;<br />
<!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>Stumbling
as one that finds nothing: but now!&mdash;as one finding too much:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Love through mid-midnight will see:<br />

Clasp him once more, the heroic, the dear!<br />

Faces boldest at bay;<br />
Where the solitude deepens,<br />
Till almost you hear<br />
The blood-beat of the heart<br />
As the quarry slips near;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Encoronet thy brow,<br />
Or if the false Italian priest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pretend to loose the vow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>O then to white the red rose went<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On Edith&rsquo;s cheek abiding!<br />
With even glance she answer&rsquo;d meek<br />
&lsquo;I leave the life I did not seek,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In holy Church confiding&rsquo;:&mdash;<br />
Then Love smiled true on Henry&rsquo;s face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>And
Anselm join&rsquo;d the hands<br />
That in one race two races bound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By everlasting bands.<br />
So Love is Lord, and Alfred&rsquo;s blood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Returns the land to sway;<br />
And all her joyous maidens join<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In their soft roundelay:</p>
<p>&mdash;For though the knight may fail in fight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The red rust edge the sword,<br />
The king his crown in dust lay down,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet Love is always Lord!</p>
<p>Edith, (who, after marriage, took the name Matilda in compliment
to Henry&rsquo;s mother), daughter to Malcolm King of Scotland by Margaret,
granddaughter of Edmund Ironside, had been brought up by her aunt Christina,
and placed in Romsey Abbey for security against Norman violence.&nbsp;
But she had always refused to take the vows, and was hence, in opposition
to her aunt&rsquo;s wish, declared canonically free to marry by Anselm;
called here an <i>Italian priest</i>, as born at Aosta.&nbsp; Henry
had been long attached to the Princess, and married her shortly after
his accession.</p>

Full of gray peace, while day to darkness dies.</p>
<p>Then the forgotten dead at midnight come<br />

<p>&mdash;How so, thou say&rsquo;st!&mdash;This is the poet&rsquo;s
right!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He looks with larger sight<br />
Than they who hedge their view by present things,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The small, parochial world<br />
Of sight and touch: and what he sees, he sings.</p>
<p>The steel-shell&rsquo;d host, that, gleaming as it turns,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like autumn lightning burns,<br />
A moment&rsquo;s azure, the fresh flags that glance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As cornflowers o&rsquo;er the corn,<br />

<p>He also sees; and pierces to the heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Scanning the genuine part<br />
Each Red-Cross pilgrim plays: Some, gold-enticed;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By love or lust or fame<br />
Urged; or who yearn to kiss the grave of Christ</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; O! ere they quit the Land<br />
How maim&rsquo;d, how marr&rsquo;d, how changed from all that pride<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In which so late they left<br />
Orwell or Thames, with sails out-swelling wide</p>
<p>And music tuneable with the timing oar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Clear heard from shore to shore;<br />
All Europe streaming to the mystic East!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;Now on their sun-smit ranks<br />
The dusky squadrons close in vulture-feast,</p>
<p>And that fierce Day-star&rsquo;s blazing ball their sight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sears with excess of light;<br />
Or through dun sand-clouds the blue scimitar&rsquo;s edge<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Slopes down like fire from heaven,<br />
Mowing them as the thatcher mows the sedge.</p>

Sweet England; her fresh fields and gardens trim;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her tree-embower&rsquo;d halls;<br />
And the one face that was the world to him.</p>
<p>&mdash;And one who fought his fight and held his way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through life&rsquo;s long latter day<br />
Moving among the green, green English meads,<br />

His rest, oft &rsquo;mid his kinsfolk told the deeds</p>

Unseen:&mdash;seen only of pure Parcivale.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Thud Crusade,&rsquo; 1189-1193, is the subject of this
poem.&nbsp; Richard Coeur de Lion carried his followers by way of Sicily
and Cyprus: making a transient conquest of the latter.&nbsp; In the
Holy Land the siege of Acre consumed the time and strength of the Crusaders.&nbsp;
They suffered terribly in the wilderness of Mount Carmel, and when at
last preparing to march on Jerusalem (1192) were recalled to Ascalon.&nbsp;
Richard now advanced to Bethany, but was unable to reach the Holy City.&nbsp;
The tale is that while riding with a party of knights one of them called
out, &lsquo;This way, my lord, and you will see Jerusalem.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But Richard hid his face and said, &lsquo;Alas!&mdash;they who are not
worthy to win the Holy City are not worthy to behold it.&rsquo;</p>

BALLAD OF EVESHAM</h3>
<p>August 4: 1265</p>
<p>Earl Simon on the Abbey tower<br />
In summer sunshine stood,<br />
While helm and lance o&rsquo;er Greenhill heights<br />
Come glinting through the wood.<br />
&lsquo;My son!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;I know his flag<br />
Amongst a thousand glancing&rsquo;:&mdash;<br />
Fond father! no!&mdash;&rsquo;tis Edward stern<br />
In royal strength advancing.</p>
<p>The Prince fell on him like a hawk<br />
At Al&rsquo;ster yester-eve,<br />
And flaunts his captured banner now<br />
And flaunts but to deceive:&mdash;<br />
&mdash;Look round! for Mortimer is by,<br />
And guards the rearward river:&mdash;<br />
The hour that parted sire and son<br />
Has parted them for ever!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Young Simon&rsquo;s dead,&rsquo; he thinks, and look&rsquo;d<br />
Upon his living son:<br />
&lsquo;Now God have mercy on our souls,<br />
Our bodies are undone!<br />
But, Hugh and Henry, ye can fly<br />
Before their bowmen smite us&mdash;<br />
They come on well!&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis from me<br />
They learn&rsquo;d the skill to fight us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;&lsquo;For England&rsquo;s cause, and England&rsquo;s laws,<br />
With you we fight and fall!&rsquo;<br />
&mdash;&lsquo;Together, then, and die like men,<br />

&mdash;Then, face to face, and limb to limb,<br />
<!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>And
sword with sword inwoven,<br />
That stubborn courage of the race<br />
On Evesham field was proven</p>
<p>O happy hills!&nbsp; O summer sky<br />
Above the valley bent!<br />
Your peacefulness rebukes the rage<br />
Of blood on blood intent!<br />
No thought was then for death or life<br />
Through that long dreadful hour,<br />
While Simon &rsquo;mid his faithful few<br />
Stood like an iron tower,</p>
<p>&rsquo;Gainst which the winds and waves are hurl&rsquo;d<br />
In vain, unmoved, foursquare;<br />
And round him raged the insatiate swords<br />
Of Edward and De Clare:<br />
And round him in the narrow combe<br />
His white-cross comrades rally,<br />
While ghastly gashings, cloud the beck<br />
And crimson all the valley,</p>
<p>And triple sword-thrusts meet his sword,<br />
And thrice the charge he foils,<br />
Though now in threefold flood the foe<br />
Round those devoted boils:<br />
And still the light of England&rsquo;s cause<br />
And England&rsquo;s love was o&rsquo;er him,<br />
Until he saw his gallant boy<br />
Go down in blood before him:&mdash;</p>
<p>He hove his huge two-handed blade,<br />
He cried &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis time to die!&rsquo;<br />
And smote around him like a flail,<br />
And clear&rsquo;d a space to lie:&mdash;<br />
&lsquo;Thank God!&rsquo;&mdash;no more;&mdash;nor now could life<br />
From loved and lost divide him:&mdash;<br />

<h3>THE DIRGE OF LLYWELYN</h3>
<p>December 10: 1282</p>
<p>Llanyis on Irfon, thine oaks in the drear<br />
Red eve of December are wind-swept and sere,<br />
Where a king by the stream in his agony lies,<br />
And the life of a land ebbs away as he dies.</p>
<p>Car&aacute;doc, thy sceptre for centuries kept,<br />
Shall it pass like the ripple, unhonour&rsquo;d, unwept:<br />
Unknowing the lance, and the victim unknown,<br />
Far from Aberffraw&rsquo;s halls and Er&yacute;ri the lone!</p>
<p>O dark day of winter and Cambria&rsquo;s shame,<br />
To the treason of Builth when from Gwynedd he came,<br />
And Walwyn and Frankton and Mortimer fell<br />
Closed round unawares by the fold in the dell!</p>
<p>&mdash;As who, where the shadow beneath him is thrown,<br />
By some well in Saharan high noontide alone<br />
Sits under the palm-tree, nor hears the low breath<br />
Of the russet-maned foe panting hot for his death;</p>
<p>So Llywelyn,&mdash;unarm&rsquo;d, unaware:&mdash;Is it she,<br />
Bright star of his morning, when Gwynedd was free,<br />
Fair bride, the long sought, taken early, goes by?<br />
In the heart of the breeze the lost Eleanor&rsquo;s sigh?</p>
<p><!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>Or
the one little daughter&rsquo;s sweet face with a gleam<br />
Of glamour looks out, as the dream in a dream?<br />
Or for childhood&rsquo;s first sunshine and calm does he yearn,<br />
As the days of Maesmynan in memory return?</p>
<p>Or,&mdash;dear to the heart&rsquo;s-blood as first-love or wife,&mdash;<br />
The mountains whose freedom was one with his life,<br />
Gray farms and green vales of that ancient domain,<br />
The thousand-years&rsquo; kingdom, he dreams of again?</p>
<p>Or is it the rage of stark Edward; the base<br />
Unkingly revenge on a kinglier race;<br />
The wrong idly wrought on the patriot dead;<br />
The dark castle of doom; the scorn-diadem&rsquo;d head?</p>
<p>&mdash;Lo, where Rhodri and Owain await thee!&mdash;The foe<br />
Slips nearing in silence: one flash&mdash;and one blow!<br />
And the ripple that passes wafts down to the Wye<br />
The last prayer of Llywelyn, the nation&rsquo;s last sigh.</p>
<p>But Llanynis yet sees the white rivulet gleam,<br />
And the leaf of December fall sere on the stream;<br />
While Irfon his dirge whispers on through the combe,<br />
And the purple-topt hills gather round in their gloom.</p>
<p><i>Where a king</i>; The war in which Llywelyn fell was the inevitable
result of the growing power of England under Edward I; and, considering
the vast preponderance of weight against the Welsh Prince it could not
have ended but in the conquest of Wales.&nbsp; Yet its issue, as told
here, was determined as if by chance.</p>
<p><i>Aberffraw</i>; in Anglesea: the residence of the royal line of
Gywnedd from the time of Rhodri Mawr onwards.</p>
<p><i>Eryri</i>; the Eagle&rsquo;s rock is a name for Snowdon.&nbsp;
The bird has been seen in the neighbourhood within late years.</p>
<p><i>Is it she</i>; Eleanor, daughter to Simon de Montfort.&nbsp; After
some years of betrothal and impediment arising from the jealousy of
Edward I, she and Llywelyn were married in 1278.&nbsp; But after only
two years of happiness, Eleanor died, leaving one child, Catharine or
Gwenllian.</p>
<p><!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span><i>Maesmynan</i>;
by Caerwys in Flintshire; where Llywelyn lived retiredly in youth.</p>
<p><i>The thousand-years&rsquo; kingdom</i>; The descent of the royal
house of North Wales is legendarily traced from Caradoc-Caractacus.&nbsp;
But the accepted genealogy of the Princes of Gwynedd begins with Cunedda
Wledig (Paramount) cir. 400: ending in 1282 with Llywelyn son of Gruffydd.</p>
<p><i>The scorn-diadem&rsquo;d head</i>; On finding whom he had slain,
Frankton carried Llywelyn&rsquo;s head to Edward at Rhuddlan, who, with
a barbarity unworthy of himself, set it over the Tower of London, wreathed
in mockery of a prediction (ascribed to Merlin) upon the coronation
of a Welsh Prince in London.</p>
<p><i>Rhodri and Owain</i>; Rhodri Mawr, (843), who united under his
supremacy the other Welsh principalities, Powys and Dinefawr; Owain
Gwynedd, (1137),&mdash;are among the most conspicuous of Llywelyn&rsquo;s
royal predecessors.</p>
<h3>THE REJOICING OF THE LAND</h3>
<p>1295</p>
<p>So the land had rest! and the cloud of that heart-sore struggle and
pain<br />
Rose from her ancient hills, and peace shone o&rsquo;er her again,<br />
Sunlike chasing the plagues wherewith the land was defiled;<br />
And the leprosy fled, and her flesh came again, as the flesh of a child.<br />
&mdash;They were stern and stark, the three children of Rolf, the first
from Anjou:<br />
For their own sake loving the land, mayhap, but loving her true;<br />
France the wife, and England the handmaid; yet over the realm<br />
Their eyes were in every place, their hands gripp&rsquo;d firm on the
helm.<br />
Villein and earl, the cowl and the plume, they were bridled alike;<br />
One law for all, but arm&rsquo;d law,&mdash;not swifter to aid than
to strike.<br />
<!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>Lo,
in the twilight transept, the holy places of God,<br />
Not with sunset the steps of the altar are dyed, but with scarlet of
blood!<br />
Clang of iron-shod feet, and sheep for their shepherd who cry;<br />
Curses and swords that flash, and the victim proffer&rsquo;d to die!<br />
&mdash;Bare thy own back to the smiter, O king, at the shrine of the
dead:<br />
Thy friend thou hast slain in thy folly; the blood of the Saint on thy
head:<br />
Proud and priestly, thou say&rsquo;st;&mdash;yet tender and faithful
and pure;<br />
True man, and so, true saint;&mdash;the crown of his martyrdom sure:&mdash;<br />
As friend with his friend, he could brave thee and warn; thou hast silenced
the voice,<br />
Ne&rsquo;er to be heard again:&mdash;nor again will Henry rejoice!<br />
Green Erin may yield her, fair Scotland submit; but his sunshine is
o&rsquo;er;<br />
The tooth of the serpent, the child of his bosom, has smote him so sore:&mdash;<br />
Like a wolf from the hounds he dragg&rsquo;d off to his lair, not turning
to bay:&mdash;<br />
Crying &lsquo;shame on a conquer&rsquo;d king!&rsquo;&mdash;the grim
ghost fled sullen away.<br />
&mdash;Then, as in gray Autumn the heavens are pour&rsquo;d on the rifted
hillside,<br />
When the Rain-stars mistily gleam, and torrents leap white in their
pride,<br />
And the valley is all one lake, and the late, unharvested shocks<br />
Are rapt to the sea, the dwellings of man, the red kine and the flocks,&mdash;<br />
O&rsquo;er England the ramparts of law, the old landmarks of liberty
fell,<br />
As the brothers in blood and in lust, twin horror begotten of hell,<br />
<!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>Suck&rsquo;d
all the life of the land to themselves, like Lofoden in flood,<br />
One in his pride, in his subtlety one, mocking England and God.<br />
Then tyranny&rsquo;s draught&mdash;once only&mdash;we drank to the dregs!&mdash;and
the stain<br />
Went crimson and black through the soul of the land, for all time, not
in vain!<br />
We bore the bluff many-wived king, rough rival and victor of Rome;<br />
We bore the stern despot-protector, whose dawning and sunset were gloom;<br />
For they temper&rsquo;d the self of the tyrant with love of the land,<br />
Some touch of the heart, some remorse, refraining the grip of the hand.<br />
But John&rsquo;s was blackness of darkness, a day of vileness and shame;<br />
Shrieks of the tortured, and silence, and outrage the mouth cannot name.<br />
&mdash;O that cry of the helpless, the weak that writhe under the foe,<br />
Wrong man-wrought upon man, dumb unwritten annals of woe!<br />
Cry that goes upward from earth as she rolls through the peace of the
skies<br />
&lsquo;How long?&nbsp; Hast thou forgotten, O God!&rsquo; . . . and
silence replies!<br />
Silence:&mdash;and then was the answer;&mdash;the light o&rsquo;er Windsor
that broke,<br />
The Meadow of Law&mdash;true Avalon where the true Arthur awoke!<br />
&mdash;Not thou, whose name, as a seed o&rsquo;er the world, plume-wafted
on air,<br />
Britons on each side sea,&mdash;Caerlleon and Cumbria,&mdash;share,<br />
Joy of a downtrod race, dear hope of freedom to-be,<br />
<!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>Dream
of poetic hearts, whom the vision only can see! . . .<br />
For thine were the fairy knights, fair ideals of beauty and song;<br />
But ours, in the ways of men, walk&rsquo;d sober, and stumbling, and
strong;&mdash;<br />
Stumbling as who in peril and twilight their pathway trace out,<br />
Hard to trace, and untried, and the foe above and about;<br />
For the Charter of Freedom, the voice of the land in her Council secure<br />
All doing, all daring,&mdash;and, e&rsquo;en when defeated, of victory
sure!<br />
Langton, our Galahad, first, stamp&rsquo;d Leader by Rome unaware,<br />
Pembroke and Mowbray, Fitzwarine, Fitzalan, Fitzwalter, De Clare:&mdash;<br />
&mdash;O fair temple of Freedom and Law!&mdash;the foundations ye laid:&mdash;<br />
But again came the storm, and the might of darkness and wrong was array&rsquo;d,<br />
A warfare of years; and the battle raged, and new heroes arose<br />
From a soil that is fertile in manhood&rsquo;s men, and scatter&rsquo;d
the foes,<br />
And set in their place the bright pillars of Order, Liberty&rsquo;s
shrine,<br />
O&rsquo;er the land far-seen, as o&rsquo;er Athens the home of Athena
divine.<br />
&mdash;So the land had rest:&mdash;and the cloud of that heart-sore
struggle and pain<br />
Sped from her ancient hills, and peace shone o&rsquo;er her again,<br />
Sunlike chasing the plagues wherewith the land was defiled:<br />
And the leprosy fled, and her flesh came again, as the flesh of a child.<br />
For lo! the crown&rsquo;d Statesman of Law, Justinian himself of his
realm,<br />
<!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>Edward,
since Alfred our wisest of all who have watch&rsquo;d by the helm!<br />
He who yet preaches in silence his life-word, the light of his way,<br />
From his marble unadorn&rsquo;d chest, in the heart of the West Minster
gray,<br />
<i>Keep thy Faith</i> . . . In the great town-twilight, this city of
gloom,<br />
&mdash;O how unlike that blithe London he look&rsquo;d on!&mdash;I look
on his tomb,<br />
In the circle of kings, round the shrine, where the air is heavy with
fame,<br />
Dust of our moulder&rsquo;d chieftains, and splendour shrunk to a name.<br />
Silent synod august, ye that tried the delight and the pain,<br />
Trials and snares of a throne, was the legend written in vain?<br />
Speak, for ye know, crown&rsquo;d shadows! who down each narrow and
strait<br />
As ye might, once guided,&mdash;a perilous passage,&mdash;the keel of
the State,<br />
Fourth Henry, fourth Edward, Elizabeth, Charles,&mdash;now ye rest from
your toil,<br />
Was it best, when by truth and compass ye steer&rsquo;d, or by statecraft
and guile?<br />
Or is it so hard, that steering of States, that as men who throw in<br />
With party their life, honour soils his own ermine, a lie is no sin?
. . .<br />
&mdash;Not so, great Edward, with thee,&mdash;not so!&mdash;For he learn&rsquo;d
in his youth<br />
The step straightforward and sure, the proud, bright bearing of truth:&mdash;<br />
Arm&rsquo;d against Simon at Evesham, yet not less, striking for Law,&mdash;<br />
Ages of temperate freedom, a vision of order, he saw!&mdash;<br />
&mdash;Vision of opulent years, a murmur of welfare and peace:<br />

golden-globed, plain waving in golden increase;<br />
Hopfields fairer than vineyards, green laughing tendrils and bine;<br />
Woodland misty in sunlight, and meadow sunny with kine;&mdash;<br />
Havens of heaving blue, where the keels of Guienne and the Hanse<br />
Jostle and creak by the quay, and the mast goes up like a lance,<br />
Gay with the pennons of peace, and, blazon&rsquo;d with Adria&rsquo;s
dyes,<br />
Purple and orange, the sails like a sunset burn in the skies.<br />
Bloodless conquests of commerce, that nation with nation unite!<br />
Hand clasp&rsquo;d frankly in hand, not steel-clad buffets in fight:<br />
On the deck strange accents and shouting; rough furcowl&rsquo;d men
of the north,<br />
Genoa&rsquo;s brown-neck&rsquo;d sons, and whom swarthy Smyrna sends
forth:<br />
Freights of the south; drugs potent o&rsquo;er death from the basilisk
won,<br />
Odorous Phoenix-nest, and spice of a sunnier sun:&mdash;<br />
Butts of Malvasian nectar, Messene&rsquo;s vintage of old,<br />
Cyprian webs, damask of Arabia mazy with gold:<br />
Sendal and Samite and Tarsien, and sardstones ruddy as wine,<br />
Graved by Athenian diamond with forms of beauty divine.<br />
To the quay from the gabled alleys, the huddled ravines of the town,<br />
Twilights of jutting lattice and beam, the Guild-merchants come down,<br />
Cheapening the gifts of the south, the sea-borne alien bales,<br />
For the snow-bright fleeces of Leom&rsquo;ster, the wealth of Devonian
vales;<br />
<!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>While
above them, the cavernous gates, on which knight-robbers have gazed<br />
Hopeless, in peace look down, their harrows of iron upraised;<br />
And Dustyfoot enters at will with his gay Autolycus load,<br />
And the maidens are flocking as doves when they fling the light grain
on the road.<br />
Low on the riverain mead, where the dull clay-cottages cling<br />
To the tall town-ward and the towers, as nests of the martin in spring,<br />
Where the year-long fever lurks, and gray leprosy burrows secure,<br />
Are the wattled huts of the Friars, the long, white Church of the poor:<br />
&mdash;Haven of wearied eyelids; of hearts that care not to live;<br />
Shadow and silence of prayer; the peace which the world cannot give!<br />
Tapers hazily gloaming through fragrance the censers outpour;<br />
Chant ever rising and rippling in sweetness, as waves on the shore;<br />
Casements of woven stone, with more than the rainbow bedyed;<br />
Beauty of holiness!&nbsp; Spell yet unbroken by riches and pride!<br />

<h3>THE PILGRIM AND THE PLOUGHMAN</h3>
<p>1382</p>
<p>It is a dream, I know:&mdash;Yet on the past<br />
Of this dear England if in thought we gaze,<br />
About her seems a constant sunshine cast;<br />
In summer calm we see and golden haze<br />
The little London of Plantagenet days;<br />
Quaint labyrinthine knot of toppling lanes,<br />
And thorny spires aflame with starlike vanes.</p>
<p>Our silver Thames all yet unspoil&rsquo;d and clear;<br />
The many-buttress&rsquo;d bridge that stems the tide;<br />
Black-timber&rsquo;d wharves; arcaded walls, that rear<br />
Long, golden-crested roofs of civic pride:&mdash;<br />
While flaunting galliots by the gardens glide,<br />
And on Spring&rsquo;s frolic air the May-song swells,<br />
Mix&rsquo;d with the music of a thousand bells.</p>
<p><!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>Beyond
the bridge a mazy forest swims,<br />
Great spars and sails and flame-tongued flags on high,<br />
Wedged round the quay, a-throng with ruddy limbs<br />
And faces bronzed beneath another sky:<br />
And &rsquo;mid the press sits one with aspect shy<br />
And downcast eyes of watching, and, the while,<br />
The deep observance of an inward smile.</p>
<p>In hooded mantle gray he smiled and sate,<br />
With ink-horn at his knees and scroll and pen.<br />
And took the toll and register&rsquo;d the freight,<br />
&rsquo;Mid noise of clattering cranes and strife of men:<br />
And all that moved and spoke was in his ken,<br />
With lines and hues like Nature&rsquo;s own design&rsquo;d<br />
Deep in the magic mirror of his mind.</p>
<p>Thence oft, returning homeward, on the book,&mdash;<br />
His of Certaldo, or the bard whose lays<br />
Were lost to love in Scythia,&mdash;he would look<br />
Till his fix&rsquo;d eyes the dancing letters daze:<br />
Then forth to the near fields, and feed his gaze<br />
On one fair flower in starry myriads spread,<br />
And in her graciousness be comforted:&mdash;</p>
<p>Then, joyous with a poet&rsquo;s joy, to draw<br />
With genial touch, and strokes of patient skill,<br />
The very image of each thing he saw:&mdash;<br />
He limn&rsquo;d the man all round, for good or ill,<br />
Having both sighs and laughter at his will;<br />
Life as it went he grasp&rsquo;d in vision true,<br />
Yet stood outside the scene his pencil drew.</p>
<p>&mdash;Man&rsquo;s inner passions in their conscience-strife,<br />
The conflicts of the heart against the heart,<br />
The mother yearning o&rsquo;er the infant&rsquo;s life,<br />
The maiden wrong&rsquo;d by wealth and lecherous art,<br />
The leper&rsquo;s loathsome cell from man apart,<br />
<!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>War&rsquo;s
hell of lust and fire, the village-woe,<br />
The tinsel chivalry veiling shame below,&mdash;</p>
<p>Not his to draw,&mdash;to see, perhaps:&mdash;Our eyes<br />
Hold bias with our humour:&mdash;His, to paint<br />
With Nature&rsquo;s freshness, what before him lies:<br />
The knave, the fool; the frolicsome, the quaint:<br />
His the broad jest, the laugh without restraint,<br />
The ready tears, the spirit lightly moved;<br />
Loving the world, and by the world beloved.</p>
<p>So forth fared Chaucer on his pilgrimage<br />
Through England&rsquo;s humours; in immortal song<br />
Bodying the form and pressure of his age,<br />
Tints gay as pure, and delicate as strong;<br />
Still to the Tabard the blithe travellers throng,<br />
Seen in his mind so vividly, that we<br />
Know them more clearly than the men we see.</p>
<p>Fair France, bright Italy, those numbers train&rsquo;d;<br />
First in his pages Nature wedding Art<br />
Of all our sons of song; yet he remain&rsquo;d<br />
True English of the English at his heart:&mdash;<br />
He stood between two worlds, yet had no part<br />
In that new order of the dawning day<br />
Which swept the masque of chivalry away.</p>
<p>O Poet of romance and courtly glee<br />
And downcast eager glance that shuns the sky,<br />
Above, about, are signs thou canst not see,<br />
Portents in heaven and earth!&mdash;And one goes by<br />
With other than thy prosperous, laughing eye,<br />
Framing the rough web of his rueful lays,<br />
The sorrow and the sin&mdash;with bitter gaze</p>
<p>As down the Strand he stalks, a sable shade<br />
Of death, while, jingling like the elfin train,<br />
<!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>In
silver samite knight and dame and maid<br />
Ride to the tourney on the barrier&rsquo;d plain;<br />
And he must bow in humble mute disdain,<br />
And that worst woe of baffled souls endure,<br />
To see the evil that they may not cure.</p>
<p>For on sweet Malvern Hill one morn he lay,<br />
Drowsed by the music of the constant stream:&mdash;<br />
Loud sang the cuckoo, cuckoo!&mdash;for the May<br />
Breathed summer: summer floating like a dream<br />
From the far fields of childhood, with a gleam<br />
Of alien freshness on her forehead fair,<br />
And Heaven itself within the common air.</p>
<p>Then on the mead in vision Langland saw<br />
A pilgrim-throng; not missal-bright as those<br />
Whom Chaucer&rsquo;s hand surpass&rsquo;d itself to draw,<br />
Gay as the lark, and brilliant as the rose;&mdash;<br />
But such as dungeon foul or spital shows,<br />
Or the serf&rsquo;s fever-den, or field of fight,<br />
When festering sunbeams on the wounded smite.</p>
<p>No sainted shrine the motley wanderers seek,<br />
Pilgrims of life upon the field of scorn,<br />
Mocking and mock&rsquo;d; with plague and hunger weak,<br />
And haggard faces bleach&rsquo;d as those who mourn,<br />
And footsteps redden&rsquo;d with the trodden thorn;<br />
Blind stretching hands that grope for truth in vain,<br />
Across a twilight demon-haunted plain.</p>
<p>A land whose children toil and rot like beasts,<br />
Robbers and robb&rsquo;d by turns, the dreamer sees:&mdash;<br />
Land of poor-grinding lords and faithless priests,<br />
Where wisdom starves and folly thrones at ease<br />
&rsquo;Mid lavishness and lusts and knaveries;<br />
Times out of joint, a universe of lies,<br />
Till Love divine appear in Ploughman&rsquo;s guise</p>
<p><!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>To
burn the gilded tares and save the land,<br />
Risen from the grave and walking earth again:&mdash;<br />
&mdash;And as he dream&rsquo;d and kiss&rsquo;d the nail-pierced hand,<br />
A hundred towers their Easter voices rain<br />
In silver showers o&rsquo;er hill and vale and plain,<br />
And the air throbb&rsquo;d with sweetness, and he woke<br />
And all the dream in light and music broke.</p>
<p>&mdash;He look&rsquo;d around, and saw the world he left<br />
When to that visionary realm of song<br />
His spirit fled from bonds of flesh bereft;<br />
And on the vision he lay musing long,<br />
As o&rsquo;er his soul rude minstrel-echoes throng,<br />
Old measures half-disused; and grasp&rsquo;d his pen,<br />
And drew his cottage-Christ for homely men.</p>
<p>Thus Langland also took his pilgrimage;<br />
Rough lone knight-errant on uncourtly ways,<br />
And wrong and woe were charter&rsquo;d on his page,<br />
With some horizon-glimpse of sweeter days.<br />
And on the land the message of his lays<br />
Smote like the strong North-wind, and cleansed the sky<br />
With wholesome blast and bitter clarion-cry,</p>
<p>Summoning the people in the Ploughman&rsquo;s name.<br />
&mdash;So fought his fight, and pass&rsquo;d unknown away;<br />
Seeking no other praise, no sculptured fame<br />
Nor laureate honours for his artless lay,<br />
Nor in the Minster laid with high array;&mdash;<br />
But where the May-thorn gleams, the grasses wave,<br />
And the wind sighs o&rsquo;er a forgotten grave.</p>
<p>Langland, whom I have put here in contrast with Chaucer, is said
to have lived between 1332 and 1400.&nbsp; His <i>Vision of Piers the
Plowman</i> (who is partially identified with our blessed Saviour),
with some added poems, forms an allegory on life in England, in Church
and State, as it appeared to him during the dislocated and corrupt age
which followed the superficial glories of Edward the Third&rsquo;s earlier
years.</p>
<p><!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span><i>Took
the toll</i>; Amongst other official employments, Chaucer was Comptroller
of the Customs in the Port of London.&nbsp; See his <i>House of Fame</i>;

Pt. iii).</p>
<p><i>The Tabard</i>; Inn in Southwark whence the pilgrims to Canterbury
start.</p>

What but a child with thy brothers?<br />

<p>Chosen darling of Heaven,<br />
Yet at heart wast only a child!<br />
And for thee the wild things of Nature<br />
Sot aside their nature wild:&mdash;<br />
The brown-eyed fawn of the forest<br />

The squirrel slipp&rsquo;d down from the fir,<br />
And nestled his gentleness on thee.</p>

Like voices they follow the maid<br />
As she follows her sheep in the valley<br />
From the dawn to the folding shade:&mdash;<br />
For the world that we cannot see<br />
Is the world of her earthly seeing;<br />
From the air of the hills of God<br />
She draws her breath and her being.</p>
<p>Dances by beech tree and fountain,<br />
They know her no longer:&mdash;apart<br />
Sitting with thought and with vision<br />
In the silent shrine of the heart.<br />
And a voice henceforth and for ever<br />
Within, without her, is sighing<br />
&lsquo;Pity for France, O pity,<br />
France the beloved, the dying!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;Now between church-wall and cottage<br />
What comes in the blinding light,<br />
&mdash;Rainbow plumes and armour,<br />

That licks out its flames to take thee;&mdash;<br />
For He who loves thee in heaven<br />

Wrongs that men from men endure<br />

<p>&lsquo;On the 29th of March 1461 the two armies encountered one another
at Towton Field, near Tadcaster.&nbsp; In the numbers engaged, as well
as in the terrible obstinacy of the struggle, no such battle had been
seen in England since the field of Senlac.&nbsp; The two armies together
numbered nearly 120,000 men&rsquo;: (<i>Green</i>, B. IV: ch. vi).</p>

has kindly pointed out to me that <i>Wharfe</i>, which from a brook
received the bloodshed of Towton, does not discharge into <i>Ouse</i>

<p>If, looking at England, one point may be singled out in that long
movement, generalized under the name of the Renaissance, as critical,
it is the introduction of the Greek and Latin literature:&mdash;which
has remained ever since conspicuously the most powerful and enlarging
element, the most effectively educational, among all blanches of human
study.</p>
<p><i>In the vale Of fair Aosta</i>; See Anselm&rsquo;s youthful vision
of the gleaners and the palace of heaven (Green: <i>History</i>, B.
II: ch. ii).</p>
<p><i>His Great Work</i>; Roger Bacon&rsquo;s so-named <i>Opus Majus</i>:
&lsquo;At once,&rsquo; says Whewell, &lsquo;the Encyclopaedia and the
Novum Organum of the thirteenth century.&rsquo;&nbsp; Like Vergil, Bacon
passed at one time for a magician.</p>
<p><i>That new doctrine</i>; Grocyn was perhaps the first Englishman
who studied Greek under Chalcondylas the Byzantine at Florence; certainly
the first who lectured on Greek in England.&nbsp; This was in the Hall
of Exeter College, Oxford, in 1491.&nbsp; To him Erasmus (1499) came
to study the language.&mdash;See the brilliant account of the revival
of learning in Green, <i>Hist</i>. B. V: ch. ii.</p>
<p><i>Master, who alone</i>; See <i>The Poet&rsquo;s Euthanasia</i>.</p>
<p><i>Sebastian</i>; Cabot, who, in 1497, sailed from Bristol, and reached
Florida.</p>
<p><i>The golden sun</i>; Refers to Copernicus; whose solar system was,
however, not published till 1543.</p>
<p><i>The little-ones</i>; Colet, Dean of S. Paul&rsquo;s, founded the
school in 1510.&nbsp; <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>&lsquo;The
bent of its founder&rsquo;s mind was shown by the image of the Child
Jesus over the master&rsquo;s chair, with the words <i>Hear ye Him</i>
graven beneath it&rsquo; (Green: B. V: ch. iv).</p>
<p><i>Fifty years</i>; Between 1570 and 1620 lies almost all the glorious
production of our so-called Elizabethan period.</p>
<p><i>From Libethrion</i>;&mdash;<i>Nymphae, noster amor, Libethrides</i>!

to James I of England.</p>

and unsatisfactory career of Margaret Tudor, whom I have here only treated

<h3>LONDON BRIDGE</h3>
<p>July 6: 1535</p>
<p>The midnight moaning stream<br />
Draws down its glassy surface through the bridge<br />
That o&rsquo;er the current casts a tower&rsquo;d ridge,<br />
Dark sky-line forms fantastic as a dream;<br />
And cresset watch-lights on the bridge-gate gleam,<br />
Where &rsquo;neath the star-lit dome gaunt masts upbuoy<br />
No flag of festive joy,<br />
But blanching spectral heads;&mdash;their heads, who died<br />
Victims to tyrant-pride,<br />
Martyrs of Faith and Freedom in the day<br />
Of shame and flame and brutal selfish sway.</p>
<p>And one in black array<br />
Veiling her Rizpah-misery, to the gate<br />
Comes, and with gold and moving speech sedate<br />
Buys down the thing aloft, and bears away<br />
Snatch&rsquo;d from the withering wind and ravens&rsquo; prey:<br />
And as a mother&rsquo;s eyes, joy-soften&rsquo;d, shed<br />
Tears o&rsquo;er her young child&rsquo;s head,<br />
Golden and sweet, from evil saved; so she<br />
O&rsquo;er this, sad-smilingly,<br />
Mangled and gray, unwarm&rsquo;d by human breath,<br />
Clasping death&rsquo;s relic with love passing death.</p>
<p><!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>So
clasping now! and so<br />
When death clasps her in turn! e&rsquo;en in the grave<br />
Nursing the precious head she could not save,<br />
Tho&rsquo; through each drop her life-blood yearn&rsquo;d to flow<br />
If but for him she might to scaffold go:&mdash;<br />
And O! as from that Hall, with innocent gore<br />
Sacred from roof to floor,<br />
To that grim other place of blood he went&mdash;<br />
What cry of agony rent<br />
The twilight,&mdash;cry as of an Angel&rsquo;s pain,&mdash;<br />
<i>My father, O my father</i>! . . . and in vain!</p>
<p>Then, as on those who lie<br />
Cast out from bliss, the days of joy come back,<br />

And teased the rabbit-hutch, and fed the dove<br />

Alighting,&mdash;in his visitation sweet,<br />
Led on by little hands, and eager feet.</p>

A little stray from Heaven, for reverence here<br />
Sent down, and comfort dear:<br />
All care well paid-for by one pure caress,<br />
And life made happy in their happiness.</p>

<p>Blest hour, as on green happy slopes I lie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gray walls around and high,<br />
While long-ranged arches lessen on the view,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And one high gracious curve<br />
Of shaftless window frames the limpid blue.</p>
<p>&mdash;God&rsquo;s altar erst, where wind-set rowan now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Waves its green-finger&rsquo;d bough,<br />
And the brown tiny creeper mounts the bole<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With curious eye alert,<br />
And beak that tries each insect-haunted hole,</p>
<p>And lives her gentle life from nest to nest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And dies undispossess&rsquo;d:<br />
Whilst all the air is quick with noise of birds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where once the chant went up;<br />
Now musical with a song more sweet than words.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Still &rsquo;tis the house of God!<br />
Beauty by desolation unsubdued:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all the past is here,<br />
Thronging with thought this holy solitude.</p>
<p>I see the taper-stars, the altars gay;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And those who crouch and pray;<br />
The white-robed crowd in close monastic stole,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who hither fled the world<br />
To find the world again within the soul.</p>
<p>Yet here the pang of Love&rsquo;s defeat, the pride<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of life unsatisfied,<br />
Might win repose or anodyne; here the weak,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Their hours are struck by prayer;<br />
Freed from the bonds of freedom, the distress<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of choice, on life&rsquo;s storm-sea<br />
They gaze unharm&rsquo;d, and know their happiness.</p>

His lustful eye, and seized the prey his own.</p>

<p>1553-4</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two ships upon the steel-blue Arctic seas<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When day was long and night itself was day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forged heavily before the South West breeze<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the steadfast star they curved their way;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Two specks of man, two only signs of life,<br />
Where with all breathing things white Death keeps endless strife.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Northern Cape is sunk: and to the crew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This zone of sea, with ice-floes wedged and rough,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Domed by its own pure height of tender blue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seems like a world from the great world cut off:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While, round the horizon clasp&rsquo;d, a ring of white,<br />
Snow-blink from snows unseen, walls them with angry light.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that long day compact of many days<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Breaks up and wanes; and equal night beholds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their hapless driftage past uncharted bays,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in her chilling, killing arms enfolds:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While the near stars a thousand arrowy darts<br />
Bend from their diamond eyes, as the low sun departs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the weird Northern Dawn in idle play<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mocks their sad souls, now trickling down the sky<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In many-quivering lines of golden spray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then blazing out, an Iris-arch on high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With fiery lances fill&rsquo;d and feathery bars,<br />
And sheeny veils that hide or half-reveal the stars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silent spectacle!&nbsp; Yet sounds, &rsquo;tis
said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On their forlornness broke; a hissing cry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of mockery and wild laugh, as, overhead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>Those
blight fantastic squadrons flaunted by:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that false dawn, long nickering, died away,<br />
And the Sun came not forth, and Heaven withheld the day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O King Hyperion, o&rsquo;er the Delphic dale<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reigning meanwhile in glory, Ocean know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thine absence, and outstretch&rsquo;d an icy veil,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A marble pavement, o&rsquo;er his waters blue;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Past the Varangian fiord and Zembla hoar,<br />
And from Petsora north to dark Arzina&rsquo;s shore:&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An iron ridge o&rsquo;erhung with toppling snow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And giant beards of icicled cascade:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where, frost-imprison&rsquo;d as the long mouths go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>Good Hope</i> and her mate-ship lay embay&rsquo;d;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And those brave crews knew that all hope was gone;<br />
England be seen no more; no more the living sun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A store that daily lessens &rsquo;neath their eyes;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A little dole of light and fire and food:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While Night upon them like a vampyre lies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bleaching the frame and thinning out the blood;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And through the ships the frost-bit timbers groan,<br />
And the Guloine prowls round, with dull heart-curdling moan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then sometimes on the soul, far off, how far!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Came back the shouting crowds, the cannon-roar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The latticed palace glittering like a star,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The buoyant Thames, the green, sweet English shore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The heartful prayers, the fireside blaze and bliss,<br />
The little faces bright, and woman&rsquo;s last, last kiss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;O yet, for all their misery, happy souls!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Happy in faith and love and fortitude:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For you, one thought of England dear controls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All shrinking of the flesh at death so rude!<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Touch&rsquo;d, and they stiffen&rsquo;d at their task,

&nbsp;&nbsp; And loosed the sea from winter and duresse,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The seal-wrapt race that roams the Lapland main<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Saw in Arzina, wondering, fearing more,<br />
The tatter&rsquo;d ships, in snows entomb&rsquo;d and vaulted o&rsquo;er:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And clomb the decks, and found the gallant crew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As forms congeal&rsquo;d to stone, where frozen fate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Took each man in his turn, and gently slew:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor knew the heroic chieftain, as he sate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; English through every fibre, in his place,<br />
The smile of duty done upon the steadfast face.</p>
<p>Sir Hugh Willoughby, in the <i>Bona Esperanza</i>, with two other
vessels, sailed May 10, 1553, saluting the palace of Greenwich is they
passed.&nbsp; By September 18 he, with one consort, reached the harbour
of Arzina, where all perished early in 1554.&nbsp; His will, dated in
January of that year, was found when the ships were discovered by the
Russians soon after.</p>
<p>Willoughby has been taken here as the representative of the great
age of British naval adventure and exploration.</p>
<p><i>Arzina</i> is placed near the western headland of the White Sea,
east of the Waranger Fiord, and west of Nova Zembla and the mouth of
the Petchora.</p>

<p>Mary of Scotland is one of the five or six figures in our history
who rouse an undying personal interest.&nbsp; Volumes have been and
will be written on her:&mdash;yet if we put aside the distorting mists
of national and political and theological partisanship, the common laws
of human nature will give an easy clue to her conduct and that of her
enemies.</p>
<p>Her flight from Scotland, as the turning-point in Mary&rsquo;s unhappy
and pathetic career, has been here chosen for the moment whence to survey
it.</p>
<p><i>On Holyrood stairs</i>; Riccio was murdered on March 9, 1566.&nbsp;
Mary&rsquo;s exclamation when she heard of his death next day, <i>No
more tears</i>; <i>I will think upon a revenge</i>, is the sufficient
explanation,&mdash;in a great degree should be the sufficient justification,
with those who still hold her an accomplice in the death of Darnley
and the marriage with Bothwell,&mdash;(considering the then lawless
state of Scotland, the complicity of the leading nobles, the hopelessness
of justice)&mdash;of her later conduct whilst Queen.</p>
<p><i>The friend</i>; In Riccio&rsquo;s murder the main determinant
was his efficiency in aiding Mary towards a Roman Catholic reaction,
which might have deprived a large body of powerful nobles of the church
lands.&nbsp; The death of Riccio (Mary&rsquo;s most faithful friend)
prevented this: the death of Darnley became necessary to secure the
position gained.</p>
<p><i>A brother&rsquo;s hypocrite tears</i>; Murray, in whose interest
Riccio was murdered, and whose privity to the murder (as afterwards
to that of Darnley) is reasonably, though indirectly, proved, affected
to shed tears on seeing his sister.&nbsp; Next day she learned the details
of the plot, and her half-brother&rsquo;s share in it.</p>
<p><i>The flight</i>; Mary then fled by a secret passage from Holyrood
Palace <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>through

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Guelderland
outspreads<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her green wide water-meads<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Laced by the silver of the parted Rhine;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where round the horizon
low<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The waving millsails
go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And poplar avenues stretch their pillar&rsquo;d line;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That morn a clinging mist uncurl&rsquo;d<br />
Its folds o&rsquo;er South-Fen town, and blotted out the world.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, as the
gray dawn broke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cloked by that ghost-white
cloke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fifty knights of England sat in steel;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each man all ear, for
eye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could not his nearest
spy;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in the mirk&rsquo;s dim hiding heart they feel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;Feel more than hear,&mdash;the
signal sound<br />
Of tramp and hoof and wheel, and guns that bruise the ground.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>&mdash;Sudden, the mist gathers up like a curtain, the theatre clear;<br />
Stage of unequal conflict, and triumph purchased too dear!<br />
<!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>Half
our boot treasures of gallanthood there, with axe and with glaive,<br />
One against ten,&mdash;what of that?&mdash;We are ready for glory or

There, Spain and her thousands nearing, with lightning-tongued weapons
of war;&mdash;<br />
Ebro&rsquo;s swarthy sons, and the bands from Epirus afar;<br />
Crescia, Gonzaga, del Vasto,&mdash;world-famous names of affright,<br />
Veterans of iron and blood, insatiate engines of fight:&mdash;<br />

Star of Philip the peerless,&mdash;and now at height of his noon,<br />

<p>Red walls of Zutphen behind; before them, Spain in her might:&mdash;<br />
O! &rsquo;tis not war, but a game of heroic boyish delight!<br />
For on, like a bolt-head of steel, go the fifty, dividing their way,<br />
Through and over the brown mail-shirts,&mdash;Farnese&rsquo;s choicest
array;<br />
Over and through, and the curtel-axe flashes, the plumes in their pride<br />
Sink like the larch to the hewer, a death-mown avenue wide:<br />
While the foe in his stubbornness flanks them and bars them, with merciless
aim<br />
Shooting from musket and saker a scornful death-tongue of flame.<br />
As in an autumn afar, the Six Hundred in Chersonese hew&rsquo;d<br />
<!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>Their
road through a host, for their England and honour&rsquo;s sake wasting
their blood,<br />
Foolishness wiser than wisdom!&mdash;So these, since Azincourt morn,<br />
First showing the world the calm open-eyed rashness of Englishmen born!</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Foes ere the cloud went up, black Norris and Stanley in one<br />
Pledge iron hands and kiss swords, each his mate&rsquo;s, in the face
of the sun,<br />
Warm with the generous wine of the battle; and Willoughby&rsquo;s might<br />
To the turf bore Crescia, and lifted again,&mdash;knight honouring knight;<br />
All in the hurry and turmoil:&mdash;where North, half-booted and rough,<br />
Launch&rsquo;d on the struggle, and Sidney struck onward, his cuisses
thrown off,<br />
Rash over-courage of poet and youth!&mdash;while the memories, how<br />
At the joust long syne She look&rsquo;d on, as he triumph&rsquo;d, were
hot on his brow,<br />
&lsquo;Stella! mine own, my own star!&rsquo;&mdash;and he sigh&rsquo;d:&mdash;and
towards him a flame<br />
Shot its red signal; a shriek!&mdash;and the viewless messenger came;<br />
Found the unguarded gap, the approach left bare to the prey,<br />
Where through the limb to the life the death-stroke shatter&rsquo;d
a way.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet the allaying cup, in all that pain,<br />

true heart and brave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leal from birth to

<p>In 1585 Elizabeth, who was then aiding the United Provinces in their
resistance to Spain, sent Sir Philip Sidney (born 1554) as governor
of the fortress of Flushing in Zealand.&nbsp; The Earl of Leicester,
chosen by the Queen&rsquo;s unhappy partiality to command the English
force, named Sidney (his nephew) General of the horse.&nbsp; He marched
thence to Zutphen in Guelderland, a town besieged by the Spaniards,
in hopes of destroying a strong reinforcement which they were bringing
in aid of the besiegers.&nbsp; The details of the rash and heroic charge
which followed may be read in Motley&rsquo;s <i>History of the United
Netherlands</i>, ch. ix.</p>
<p>St. 1 <i>Guelderland</i>; in this province the Rhine divides before
entering the sea: &lsquo;gliding through a vast plain.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>South-Fen</i>;
Zutphen, on the Yssel (Rhine).</p>
<p>St. 3 <i>The bands from Epirus</i>; Crescia, the Epirote chief, commanded
a body of Albanian cavalry.&mdash;<i>The waning Dudley star</i>; Leicester,
who was near the end of his miserable career.&mdash;<i>Astrophel</i>;
Sidney celebrated his love for Penelope Devereux, Lady Rich, in the
series of Sonnets and Lyrics named <i>Astrophel and Stella</i>:&mdash;posthumously
published in 1591.&mdash;After, or with Shakespeare&rsquo;s Sonnets,
this series seems to me to offer the most powerful picture of the passion
of love in the whole range of our poetry.</p>

<blockquote><p>I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,<br />
His cuisses on his thighs: (<i>Henry IV</i>, Part I: A. iv: S. i):&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sidney flung off his &lsquo;in a fit of chivalrous extravagance.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>At
the joust</i>; In Sonnets 41 and 53 of <i>Astrophel and Stella</i> Sidney
describes how the sudden sight of his lady-love dazzled him as he rode
in certain tournaments.&nbsp; In Son. 69 he cries:</p>
<blockquote><p>I, I, O, I, may say that she is mine.</p>

Herbert&rsquo;s brief career as a parish priest was passed at Bemerton,
a pretty village near Salisbury in the vale of the Avon.&nbsp; His parsonage,
with its garden running down to the stream, and the little church across
the road in which he lies buried, remain comparatively unchanged (March
26, 1880) since he lived and mused and wrote his Poems within these
precincts.&nbsp; The justly-famous <i>Temple</i> was published shortly
after his death by his friend Nicholas Ferrar.</p>

<h3>PRINCESS ANNE</h3>
<p>November 5: 1640</p>
<p>Harsh words have been utter&rsquo;d and written on her, Henrietta
the Queen:<br />
She was young in a difficult part, on a cruel and difficult scene:&mdash;<br />
Was it strange she should fail? that the King overmuch should bow down
to her will?<br />
&mdash;So of old with the women, God bless them!&mdash;it was, so will
ever be still!<br />
Rash in counsel and rash in courage, she aided and marr&rsquo;d<br />
The shifting tides of the fight, the star of the Stuarts ill-starr&rsquo;d.<br />
In her the false Florentine blood,&mdash;in him the bad strain of the
Guise;<br />
Suspicion against her and hate, all that malice can forge and devise;&mdash;<br />
As a bird by the fowlers o&rsquo;ernetted, she shuffles and changes
her ground;<br />
No wile unlawful in war, and the foe unscrupulous round!<br />
Woman-like overbelieving Herself and the Cause and the Man,<br />
Fights with two-edged intrigue, suicidal, plan upon plan;<br />
<!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>Till
the law of this world had its way, and she fled,&mdash;like a frigate
unsail&rsquo;d,<br />
Unmasted, unflagg&rsquo;d,&mdash;to her land; and the strength of the
stronger prevail&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it was not thus, not thus, in the years of
thy springtide, O Queen,<br />
When thy children came in their beauty, and all their future unseen:<br />
When the kingdom had wealth and peace, one smile o&rsquo;er the face
of the land:<br />
England, too happy, if thou could&rsquo;st thy happiness understand!<br />
As those over Etna who slumber, and under them rankles the fire.<br />
At her side was the gallant King, her first-love, her girlhood&rsquo;s
desire,<br />
And around her, best jewels and dearest to brighten the steps of the
throne,<br />
Three golden heads, three fair little maids, in their nursery shone.<br />
&lsquo;As the mother, so be the daughters,&rsquo; they say:&mdash;nor
could mother wish more<br />
For her own, than men saw in the Queen&rsquo;s, ere the rosebud-dawning
was o&rsquo;er,<br />
Heart-wise and head-wise, a joy to behold, as they knelt for her kiss,&mdash;<br />
Best crown of a woman&rsquo;s life, her true vocation and bliss!&mdash;<br />
But the flowers were pale and frail, and the mother watch&rsquo;d them
with dread,<br />
As the sunbeams play&rsquo;d round the room on each gay, glistening
head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>Anne
in that garden of childhood grew nearest Elizabeth: she<br />
Tenderly tended and loved her, a babe with a babe on her knee:<br />
Slight and white from the cradle was Anne; a floweret born<br />
Rathe, out of season, a rose that peep&rsquo;d out when the hedge was
in thorn.<br />
&lsquo;Why should it be so with us?&rsquo; thought Elizabeth oft; for
in her<br />
The soul &rsquo;gainst the body protesting, was but more keenly astir:<br />
&lsquo;As saplings stunted by forest around o&rsquo;ershading, we two:<br />
What work for our life, my mother,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;is left us
to do?<br />
Or is&rsquo;t from the evil to come, the days without pleasure, that
God<br />
In mercy would spare us, over our childhood outstretching the rod?&rsquo;<br />
&mdash;So she, from her innocent heart; in all things seeing the best<br />
With the wholesome spirit of childhood; to God submitting the rest:<br />
Not seeing the desolate years, the dungeon of Carisbrook drear;<br />
Eyes dry-glazed with fever, and none to lend even a tear!<br />
Now, all her heart to the little one goes; for, day upon day,<br />
As a rosebud in canker, she pales and pines, and the cough has its way.<br />
And the gardens of Richmond on Thames, the fine blythe air of the vale<br />
Stay not the waning pulse, and the masters of science fail.<br />
Then the little footsteps are faint, and a child may take her with ease;<br />
As the flowers a babe flings down she is spread on Elizabeth&rsquo;s
knees,<br />
<!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>Slipping
back to the cradle-life, in her wasting weakness and pain:<br />
And the sister prays and smiles and watches the sister in vain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she watch&rsquo;d by the bed all night, and
the lights were yellow and low,<br />
And a cold blue blink shimmer&rsquo;d up from the park that was sheeted
in snow:<br />
And the frost of the passing hour, when souls from the body divide,<br />
The Sarsar-wind of the dawn, crept into the palace, and sigh&rsquo;d.<br />
And the child just turn&rsquo;d her head towards Elizabeth there as
she lay,<br />
And her little hands came together in haste, as though she would pray;<br />
And the words wrestled in her for speech that the fever-dry mouth cannot
frame,<br />
And the strife of the soul on the delicate brow was written in flame:<br />
And Elizabeth call&rsquo;d &lsquo;O Father, why does she look at me
so?<br />
Will it soon be better for Anne? her face is all in a glow&rsquo;:&mdash;<br />
But with womanly speed and heed is the mother beside her, and slips<br />
Her arm &rsquo;neath the failing head, and moistens the rose of the
lips,<br />
Pale and sweet as the wild rose of June, and whispers to pray<br />
To the Father in heaven, &lsquo;the one she likes best, my baby, to
say&rsquo;:<br />
And the soul hover&rsquo;d yet o&rsquo;er the lips, as a dove when her
pinions are spread,<br />
And the light of the after-life came again in her eyes, and she said;<br />
<!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>&lsquo;For
my long prayer it is not time; for my short one I think I have breath;<br />
<i>Lighten mine eyes, O Lord, that I sleep not the sleep of death</i>.&rsquo;<br />
&mdash;O! into life, fair child, as she pray&rsquo;d, her innocence
slept!<br />
&lsquo;It is better for her,&rsquo; they said:&mdash;and knelt, and
kiss&rsquo;d her, and wept.</p>
<p><i>In her</i>; Henrietta&rsquo;s mother was by birth Mary de&rsquo;
Medici; the great-grandmother of Charles was Mary of Guise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With Charles I,&rsquo; says Ranke, &lsquo;nothing was more
seductive than secrecy.&nbsp; The contradictions in his conduct entangled
him in embarrassments, in which his declarations, if always true in
the sense he privately gave them, were only a hair&rsquo;s-breadth removed
from actual, and even from intentional, untruth.&rsquo;&mdash;Whether
traceable to descent, or to the evil influence of Buckingham and the
intriguing atmosphere of the Spanish marriage-negotiations, this defect
in political honesty is, unquestionably, the one serious blot on the
character of Charles I.&mdash;Yet, whilst noting it, candid students
will regretfully confess that the career of Elizabeth and her counsellors
is defaced by shades of bad faith, darker and more numerous.</p>
<p><i>When the kingdom</i>; See Clarendon&rsquo;s description of England
during this period, &lsquo;enjoying the greatest calm and the fullest
measure of felicity that any people in any age for so long time together
have been blessed with.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Three golden heads</i>; Mary, the second child of Charles and
Henrietta, was born Nov. 4, 1631: Elizabeth, Dec. 28, 1635: Anne, Mar.
17, 1637.&nbsp; The last two were feeble from infancy.&nbsp; Consumption
soon showed itself in Anne, and her short life, passed at Richmond,
closed in November, 1640.&nbsp; For her last words, we are indebted
to Fuller, who adds: &lsquo;This done, the little lamb gave up the ghost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The affection and care of the royal parents is well attested.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Their arrival,&rsquo; when visiting the nursery, &lsquo;was the
signal of a general rejoicing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the latter portion of this piece I have ventured, it will be seen,
on an ideal treatment.&nbsp; The main facts, and the words of the dear
child, are historical:&mdash;for the details I appeal to any mother
who has suffered similar loss whether they could have been much otherwise.</p>
<p><i>Not seeing</i>; See the <i>Captive Child</i>.</p>
<p><i>The frost</i>; It is noticed that death, the <i>Sarsar-wind</i>
of Southey&rsquo;s <i>Thalaba</i>, often occurs at the turn between
night and day, when the atmosphere is wont to be at the coldest.</p>

<p>In the heart of the fields he loved and the hills,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; With the faded flower, the wither&rsquo;d grass;<br />

<p>John Hampden met his death at Chalgrove in an attempt to check the
raids which Prince Rupert was making from Oxford.&nbsp; Struck at the
onset in the shoulder by two carabine balls, he rode off before the
action was ended by Hazeley towards Thame, finding it impossible to
reach Pyrton, the home of his father-in-law.&nbsp; The body was carried
to his own house amid the woods and hills of the Chiltern country, and
buried in the church close by.</p>
<p><i>With his face downward</i>; This was the dying request of some
high-minded Spaniard of old, unwilling, even in the grave, as it were,
to look on the misfortunes of his country.</p>
<p><i>O&rsquo;erstrode the bounds</i>; &lsquo;After every allowance
has been made,&rsquo; says Hallam, speaking of the Long Parliament from
a date so early as August, 1641, &lsquo;he must bring very heated passions
to the records of those times, who does not perceive in the conduct
of that body a series of glaring violations, not only of positive and
constitutional, but of those higher principles which are paramount to
all immediate policy&rsquo;: (<i>Const. Hist</i>. ch. ix).</p>
<p><i>The axe</i>; A clear and impartial sketch of Stafford&rsquo;s
trial will be found in Ranke (B. viii): who deals dispassionately and
historically with an event much obscured by declamation in popular narratives.&nbsp;
Even in Hallam&rsquo;s hand the balance seems here to waver a little.</p>

CHURCHYARD IN OXFORDSHIRE</h3>
<p>September: 1643</p>
<p>Sweet air and fresh; glades yet unsear&rsquo;d by hand<br />
Of Midas-finger&rsquo;d Autumn, massy-green;<br />
Bird-haunted nooks between,<br />
Where feathery ferns, a fairy palmglove, stand,<br />
An English-Eastern band:&mdash;<br />
While e&rsquo;en the stealthy squirrel o&rsquo;er the grass<br />
Beside me to the beech-clump dares to pass:&mdash;<br />
In this still precinct of the happy dead,<br />
The sanctuary of silence,&mdash;Blessed they!<br />

Peace of God&rsquo;s house, each in his mounded bed<br />
Sleep safe, nor reck how the great world runs on;<br />
Peasant with noble here alike unknown.</p>
<p>Unknown, unnamed beneath one turf they sleep,<br />
Beneath one sky, one heaven-uplifted sign<br />
Of love assured, divine:<br />
While o&rsquo;er each mound the quiet mosses creep,<br />
The silent dew-pearls weep:<br />
&mdash;Fit haven-home for thee, O gentlest heart<br />
Of Falkland! all unmeet to find thy part<br />
In those tempestuous times of canker&rsquo;d hate<br />
When Wisdom&rsquo;s finest touch, and, by her side,<br />
Forbearance generous-eyed<br />
To fix the delicate balance of the State<br />
Were needed;&mdash;King or Nation, which should hold<br />
Supreme supremacy o&rsquo;er the kingdoms old.</p>
<p>&mdash;God&rsquo;s heroes, who? . . . Not most, or likeliest, he<br />
Whom iron will cramps to one narrow road,<br />
Driving him like a goad<br />

No blade of grass or grain:<br />
&mdash;So bare, so scourged, a prey to chaos cast<br />
The wisest despot leaves his realm at last!<br />
Though for the land he toil&rsquo;d with iron will,<br />
Earnest to reach persuasion&rsquo;s goal through power,<br />
The fruit without the flower!<br />
And pray&rsquo;d and wrestled to charm good from ill;<br />
Waking perchance, or not, in death,&mdash;to find<br />
Man fights a losing fight who fights mankind!</p>
<p>And as who in the Theban avenue,<br />
Sphinx ranged by Sphinx, goes awestruck, nor may read<br />
That ancient awful creed<br />
Closed in their granite calm:&mdash;so dim the clue,<br />
So tangled, tracking through<br />
That labyrinthine soul which, day by day<br />
Changing, yet kept one long imperious way:<br />
Strong in his weakness; confident, yet forlorn;<br />
Waning and waxing; diamond-keen, or dull,<br />
As that star Wonderful,<br />

Blissful or baleful, yet a Power throughout,<br />

<p>Lucius Cary, second Viscount Falkland, may perhaps be defined as
at once the most poetically chivalrous and the most philosophically
moderate amongst all who took part in the pre-restoration struggles.&nbsp;
He was killed in the royal army at the first battle of Newbury, Sep.
20, 1643, aged but 33 years, and buried, without mark or memorial, in
the church of Great Tew (North Oxfordshire), the manor of which he owned.</p>
<p><i>English Eastern</i>; The common brake-fern and its allies seem
to betray tropical sympathies by their late appearance and sensitiveness
to autumnal frost.</p>
<p><i>That Arlesian plain</i>; Now named the <i>Crau</i>.&nbsp; It lies
between Aries and the sea&mdash;a bare and malarious tract of great
size covered with shingle and boulders.&nbsp; Aeschylus describes it
as a &lsquo;snow-shower of round stones,&rsquo; which Zeus rained down
in aid of Heracles, who was contending with the Ligurians.</p>
<p><i>Mira</i>; A star in the <i>Whale</i>, conspicuous for its singular
and rapid changes of apparent size.</p>
<p><i>The Cause</i>; After passing through several phases this word,
in Cromwell&rsquo;s mouth, with the common logic of tyranny, became
simply a synonym for personal rule.</p>
<p><i>Smiting with iron heel</i>; The terrorism of the Protector&rsquo;s
government, and the almost universal hatred which it inspired, are powerfully
painted by Hallam.&nbsp; &lsquo;To govern according to law may sometimes
be an usurper&rsquo;s wish, but can seldom be in his power.&nbsp; The
protector abandoned all thought of it. . . . All illusion was now (1655)
gone, as to the pretended benefits of the civil war.&nbsp; It had ended
in a despotism, compared to which all the illegal practices of former
kings, all that had cost Charles his life and crown, appeared as dust
in the balance.&rsquo;</p>

blood-path</i>; The trials under which Gerard and Vowel were executed
in 1654, Slingsby and Hewit in 1658, are the most flagrant instances
of Cromwell&rsquo;s perversion of justice, and contempt for the old
liberties of England.&nbsp; But they do not stand alone.</p>
<p><i>Guile and coarseness</i>; &lsquo;A certain coarse good nature
and affability that covered the want of conscience, honour, and humanity:
quick in passion, but not vindictive, and averse to unnecessary crimes,&rsquo;
is the deliberate summing-up of Hallam,&mdash;in the love of liberty
inferior to none of our historians, and eminent above all for courageous
impartiality,&mdash;<i>iustissimus unus</i>.</p>

<h3>MARSTON MOOR</h3>
<p>July 2: 1644</p>
<p>O, summer-high that day the sun<br />
His chariot drove o&rsquo;er Marston wold:<br />
A rippling sea of amber wheat<br />
That floods the moorland vale with gold.</p>
<p>With harvest light the valley laughs,<br />
The sheaves in mellow sunshine sleep;<br />
&mdash;Too rathe the crop, too red the swathes<br />
Ere night the scythe of Death shall reap!</p>
<p>Then thick and fast o&rsquo;er all the moor<br />
The crimson&rsquo;d sabre-lightnings fly;<br />
And thick and fast the death-bolts dash,<br />
And thunder-peals to peals reply.</p>
<p>Where Evening arched her fiery dome<br />
Went up the roar of mortal foes:&mdash;<br />
Then o&rsquo;er a deathly peace the moon<br />
In silver silence sailing rose.</p>
<p><!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>Sweet
hour, when heaven is nearest home,<br />
And children&rsquo;s kisses close the day!<br />
O disaccord with nature&rsquo;s calm,<br />
Unholy requiem of the fray!</p>
<p>White maiden Queen that sail&rsquo;st above,<br />
Thy dew-tears on the fallen fling,&mdash;<br />
The blighted wreaths of civil strife,<br />
The war that can no triumph bring!</p>
<p>&mdash;O pale with that deep pain of those<br />
Who cannot save, yet must foresee,&mdash;<br />
Surveying all the ills to flow<br />
From that too-victor victory;</p>
<p>When &rsquo;gainst the unwisely guided King<br />
The dark self-centred Captain stood,<br />
And law and right and peace went down<br />
In that red sea of brothers&rsquo; blood;&mdash;</p>
<p>O long, long, long the years, fair Maid,<br />
Before thy patient eye shall view<br />
The shrine of England&rsquo;s law restored,<br />
Her homes their native peace renew!</p>
<p><i>That day</i>; The actual fight lay between 7 and 9 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Too-victor victory</i>; At Naseby, says Hallam,&mdash;and the
remark, (though Charles was not personally present), is equally true
of Marston Moor&mdash;&lsquo;Fairfax and Cromwell triumphed, not only
over the king and the monarchy, but over the parliament and the nation.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Unwisely guided</i>; &lsquo;Never would it have been wiser, in
Rupert,&rsquo; remarks Ranke, &lsquo;to avoid a decisive battle than
at that moment.&nbsp; But he held that the king&rsquo;s letter not only
empowered, but instructed him to fight.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Red sea</i>; &lsquo;The slaughter was deadly, for Cromwell had
forbidden quarter being given&rsquo;: (Ranke, ix: 3).</p>
<h3><!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>THE
FUGITIVE KING</h3>
<p>August 7: 1645</p>
<p>Cold blue cloud on the hill-tops,<br />
Cold buffets of hill-side rain:&mdash;<br />
As a bird that they hunt on the mountains,<br />
The king, he turns from Rh&ocirc;s lane:<br />
A writing of doom on his forehead,<br />
His eyes wan-wistful and dim;<br />
For his comrades seeking a shelter:<br />
But earth has no shelter for him!</p>
<p>Gray silvery gleam of armour,<br />
White ghost of a wandering king!<br />
No sound but the iron-shod footfall<br />
And the bridle-chains as they ring:<br />
Save where the tears of heaven,<br />
Shed thick o&rsquo;er the loyal hills,<br />
Rush down in the hoarse-tongued torrent,<br />
A roar of approaching ills.</p>
<p>But now with a sweeping curtain,<br />
In solid wall comes the rain,<br />
And the troop draw bridle and hide them<br />
In the bush by the stream-side plain.<br />
King Charles smiled sadly and gently;<br />
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis the Beggar&rsquo;s Bush,&rsquo; said he;<br />
&lsquo;For I of England am beggar&rsquo;d,<br />
And her poorest may pity me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;O safe in the fadeless fir-tree<br />
The squirrel may nestle and hide;<br />
And in God&rsquo;s own dwelling the sparrow<br />
Safe with her nestlings abide:&mdash;<br />
But he goes homeless and friendless,<br />
<!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>And
manlike abides his doom;<br />
For he knows a king has no refuge<br />
Betwixt the throne and the tomb.</p>
<p>And the purple-robed braes of Alban,<br />
The glory of stream and of plain,<br />
The Holyrood halls of his birthright<br />
Charles ne&rsquo;er will look on again:&mdash;<br />
And the land he loved well, not wisely,<br />
Will almost grudge him a grave:<br />
Then weep, too late, in her folly,<br />
The dark Dictator&rsquo;s slave!</p>
<p>This incident occurred during the attempt made by Charles, in the
dark final days of his struggle, to march from South Wales with the
hope of joining Montrose in Scotland.&nbsp; He appears to have halted
for the night of Aug. 6, 1645, at Old Radnor and &lsquo;the name of
<i>Rails Yat</i>, (Royal gate) still points out the spot where, on the
following morning, he left the Rh&ocirc;s Lane for the road which brought
him to shelter at Beggar&rsquo;s Bush&rsquo;: a name which is reported
to be still preserved.</p>
<h3>THE CAPTIVE CHILD</h3>

Captive bird in castle-hold,<br />

Cold and still as marble stone<br />

One wan hand beneath her cheek,<br />
One on the holy texts that tell<br />
Of God&rsquo;s love ineffable;&mdash;<br />
Last dear gift her father gave<br />
When, before to-morrow&rsquo;s grave,<br />
By no unmanly grief unmann&rsquo;d,<br />
To his little orphan band<br />
In that stress of anguish sore<br />
He bade farewell evermore.</p>
<p>Doom&rsquo;d, unhappy King!&nbsp; Had he<br />
Known the pangs in store for thee,<br />
Known the coarse fanatic rage<br />
That,&mdash;despite her flower-soft age,<br />
Maidenhood&rsquo;s first blooming fair,&mdash;<br />
Fever-struck in the imprison&rsquo;d air<br />
As rosebud on the dust-hill thrown<br />
Cast a child to die alone,&mdash;<br />
He had shed, with his last breath,<br />
Bitterer tears than tears of death!</p>
<p>As in her infant hour she took<br />
In her hand the pictured book<br />
Where Christ beneath the scourger bow&rsquo;d,<br />
Crying &lsquo;O poor man!&rsquo; aloud,<br />
And in baby tender pain<br />
Kiss&rsquo;d the page, and kiss&rsquo;d again,<br />
While the happy father smiled<br />
On his sweet warm-hearted child;<br />
&mdash;So now to him, in Carisbrook lone,<br />
All her tenderness has flown.</p>
<p>Oft with a child&rsquo;s faithful heart<br />
She has seen him act his part;<br />
Nothing in his life so well<br />
Gracing him as when he fell;<br />
<!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>Seen
him greet his bitter doom<br />
As the mercy-message Home;<br />
Seen the scaffold and the shame,<br />
The red shower that fell like flame;<br />
Till the whole heart within her died,<br />
Dying in fancy by his side.</p>
<p>&mdash;Statue-still and statue-fair<br />
Now the low wind may lift her hair,<br />
Motionless in lip and limb;<br />
E&rsquo;en the fearful mouse may skim<br />
O&rsquo;er the window-sill, nor stir<br />
From the crumb at sight of her;<br />
Through the lattice unheard float<br />
Summer blackbird&rsquo;s evening note;&mdash;<br />
E&rsquo;en the sullen foe would bless<br />
That pale utter gentleness.</p>
<p>&mdash;Eyes of heaven, that pass and peep,<br />
Do not question, if she sleep!<br />
She has no abiding here,<br />
She is past the starry sphere;<br />
Kneeling with the children sweet<br />
At the palm-wreathed altar&rsquo;s feet;<br />
&mdash;Innocents who died like thee,<br />
Heaven-ward through man&rsquo;s cruelty,<br />
To the love-smiles of their Lord<br />
Borne through pain and fire and sword.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, second daughter of Charles I. and Henrietta Maria, was
born on Innocents&rsquo; Day, 1635.&nbsp; The incident accounted in
Stanza iv occurred in 1637.&nbsp; She had been taken on a visit to Hampton
Court to her mother, who wished her to be present at her own vesper-service,
when Elizabeth, not yet two years old, became very restless.&nbsp; To
quiet her a book of devotion was shown to her.&rsquo;&nbsp; The King,
when the Queen drew his attention, said, &lsquo;She begins young!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This tale is told by Mrs. Green, in her excellent <i>Princesses of
England</i>, (London, 1853),&mdash;a book deserving to be better known,&mdash;on
the authority of the Envoy Con.</p>
<p><!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>The
first grief of a very happy and promising childhood may have been the
loss of her sister Anne in 1640.&nbsp; But by 1642, the evils of the
time began to press upon Princess Elizabeth; her mother&rsquo;s departure
from England, followed by her own capture by order of the Parliament;
her confinement under conditions of varying severity; and the final
farewell to her father, Jan. 29, 1649.</p>
<p>From that time her life was overshadowed by the sadness of her father&rsquo;s
death, her own isolation, and her increasing feebleness of health.&nbsp;
She seems to have been a singularly winning and intelligent girl, and
she hence found or inspired affection in several of the guardians successively
appointed to take charge of her.&nbsp; But if she had not been thus
marked by beauty of nature, our indignant disgust would hardly be less
at the brutal treatment inflicted by the Puritan-Independent authorities
upon this child:&mdash;at the refusal of her prayer to be sent to her
elder sister Mary, in Holland; at the captivity in Carisbrook; at the
isolation in which she was left to die.&mdash;Yet it is not she who
most merits pity!</p>
<p>In this poem, written before the plan of the book had been formed,
I find that some slight deviation from the best authorities has been
made.&nbsp; Elizabeth&rsquo;s young brother Henry, Duke of Gloster,
shared her prison: and although her own physician, Mayerne, had been
dismissed, yet some medical attendance was supplied.&mdash;Henry Vaughan
has described the patience of the young sufferer in two lovely lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thou didst not murmur, nor revile,<br />
And drank&rsquo;st thy wormwood with a smile.</p>
<p>&mdash;<i>Olor Iscanus</i>; 1651.</p>

<h3>THE WRECK OF THE ADMIRAL</h3>
<p><i>A TALE OF PRINCE RUPERT</i></p>

<p>Seventy league from Terceira they lay<br />

And inch upon inch as she settles they know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The leak on the Admiral gaining.</p>
<p>Below them &rsquo;tis death rushes greedily in;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But their signal unheeded is waving,<br />
<!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>For
the shouts by their billow-toss&rsquo;d consort unheard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are lost in the tempest&rsquo;s wild raving.</p>
<p>For Maurice in vain o&rsquo;er the bulwark leant forth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While Rupert to rescue was crying;<br />
And the voice of farewell on his face is flung back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the scud on the billow-top flying!</p>
<p>But no time was for tears, save for duty no thought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When brother is parting from brother;<br />
For Rupert the brave and his high-hearted crew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They must die, as they lived, by each other.</p>
<p>Unregarded the boat, for none care from their post<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To steal off while the Prince is beside them,<br />
All, all, side by side with his comrades to share<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the death-plunge at last shall divide them.</p>
<p>Ah, sharp in his bosom meanwhile is the smart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He alone for his king is contending!<br />
And the brightness and blaze of his youth in its prime<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must here in mid-waves have their ending!</p>
<p>&mdash;The seas they break over, the seas they press in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From fo&rsquo;csle to binnacle streaming;<br />
And a ripple runs over the Admiral&rsquo;s deck,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With blue cold witch-fire gleaming.</p>
<p>O then in a noble rebellion they rise;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They may die, but the Prince shall o&rsquo;erlive them!<br />
With a loving rough force to the boat he is thrust,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he must be saved and forgive them!</p>
<p>Now their flame-pikes they lift, the last signal for life,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flaring wild in the wild rack above them:&mdash;<br />
And each breast has one prayer for the Mercy on high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And one for the far-off who love them.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Unknown treasure-caverns of Ocean!<br />
There, where storms cannot vex, the three hundred are laid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In their silent heroic devotion.</p>
<p>Rupert, nephew to Charles through his sister Elizabeth, wife to the
Elector Palatine, after the ruin of his uncle&rsquo;s cause, carried
on the struggle at sea.&nbsp; The incident here treated occurred on
one of his last voyages, when cruising in the Atlantic near the Canaries:
it is told at full length in E. Warburton&rsquo;s narrative of Rupert&rsquo;s
life.</p>
<p><i>Brother is parting from brother</i>; Maurice, a year younger than
himself,&mdash;then in the companion ship <i>Swallow</i>, in which Rupert,
by the devoted determination of his comrades, was ultimately saved.&nbsp;
Maurice was not long after drowned in the West Indies.</p>
<p><i>Flame-pikes</i>; Two &lsquo;fire-pikes,&rsquo; it is stated, were
burned as a signal just before the flag-ship sank.&nbsp; Three hundred
and thirty-three was the estimate of the number drowned.</p>
<h3>THE RETURN OF LAW</h3>
<p>1660</p>
<p>At last the long darkness of anarchy lifts, and the dawn o&rsquo;er
the gray<br />
In rosy pulsation floods; the tremulous amber of day:<br />
In the golden umbrage of spring-tide, the dewy delight of the sward,<br />
The liquid voices awake, the new morn with music reward.<br />
Peace in her car goes up; a rainbow curves for her road;<br />
Law and fair Order before her, the reinless coursers of God;&mdash;<br />
Round her the gracious maids in circling majesty shine;<br />
They are rich in blossoms and blessings, the Hours, the white, the divine!</p>
<p><!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>Hands
in sisterly hands they unite, eye calling on eye;<br />
Smiles more speaking than words, as the pageant sweeps o&rsquo;er the
sky.<br />
Plenty is with them, and Commerce; all gifts of all lands from her horn<br />
Raining on England profuse; and, clad in the beams of the morn,<br />
Her warrior-guardian of old the red standard rears in its might;<br />
And the Love-star trembles above, and passes, light into light.</p>
<p>Many the marvels of earth, the more marvellous wonders on high,<br />
Worlds past number on worlds, blank lightless abysses of sky;<br />
But thou art the wonder of wonders, O Man!&nbsp; Thy impalpable soul,<br />
Atom of consciousness, measuring the Infinite, grasping the whole:<br />
Then, on the trivialest transiencies fix&rsquo;d, or plucking for fruit<br />
Dead-sea apples and ashes of sin, more brute than the brute.<br />
Yet in thy deepest depths, filth-wallowing orgies of night,<br />
Lust remorseless of blood, yet, allow&rsquo;d an inlet for light:<br />
As where, a thousand fathom beneath us, midnight afar<br />
Glooms in some gulph, and we gaze, and, behold! one flash of one star!<br />
For, ever, the golden gates stand open, the transit is free<br />
For the human to mix with divine; from himself to the Highest to flee.<br />
Lo on its knees by the bedside the babe:&mdash;and the song that we
hear<br />
Has been heard already in Heaven! the low-lisp&rsquo;d music is clear:&mdash;<br />
For, fresh from the hand of the Maker, the child still breathes the
light air<br />
<!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>Of
the House Angelic, the meadow where souls yet unbodied repair,<br />
Lucid with love, translucent with bliss, and know not the doom<br />
In the Marah valley of life laid up for the sons of the womb.<br />
&mdash;I speak not of grovelling hearts, souls blind and begrimed from
the birth,<br />
But the spirits of nobler strain, the elect of the children of earth:&mdash;<br />
For the needle swerves from the pole; they cannot do what they would;<br />
In their truest aim is falsehood, and ill out-balancing good.<br />
Faith&rsquo;s first felicities fade; the world-mists thicken and roll,<br />
&rsquo;Neath the heavens arching their heaven; o&rsquo;er-hazing the
eye of the soul.<br />
Then the vision is pure no longer; refracted above us arise<br />
The phantasmal figures of passion; earth&rsquo;s mirage exhaled to the
skies.<br />
And they go as the castled clouds o&rsquo;er the verge when the tempest
is laid,<br />
Towering Ambition, and Glory, and Self as Duty array&rsquo;d:&mdash;<br />
Idols no less than that idol whom lustful Ammon of yore<br />
With the death-scream of children, a furnace of blood, was fain to adore!<br />
So these, in the shrine of the soul, for a Moloch sacrifice cry,<br />
The conscience of candid childhood, the pure directness of eye:&mdash;<br />
Till the man yields himself to himself, accepting his will as his fate,<br />
And the light from above within him is darkness; the darkness how great!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Land whom the Gods,&mdash;loving most,&mdash;most
sorely in wisdom have tried,<br />
England! since Time was Time, thrice swept by the conqueror tide,<br />
<!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>Why
on thyself thrice turn, thrice crimson thy greenness in gore,<br />
With the slain of thy children, as sheep, thy meadows whitening-o&rsquo;er?<br />
Race impatiently patient; tenacious of foe as of friend;<br />
Slow to take flame; but, enflamed, that burns thyself out to the end:<br />
Slow to return to the balance, once moved; not easily sway&rsquo;d<br />
From the centre, and, star-like, retracing thy orbit through sunlight
and shade!<br />
&mdash;Without hate, without party affection, we now look back on the
fray,<br />
Through the mellowing magic of time the phantoms emerging to day!<br />
Grasping too much for self, unjust to his rival in strife,<br />
Each foe with good conscience and honour advances; war to the knife!<br />
Lo, where with feebler hand the Stuart essays him to guide<br />
The disdainful coursers of Henry, the Tudor car in its pride!<br />
For he saw not the past was past; nor the swirl and inrush of the tide,<br />
A nation arising in manhood; its will would no more be denied.<br />
They would share in the labour and peril of State; they must perish
or win;<br />
&rsquo;Tis the instinct of Freedom that cries; a voice of Nature within!<br />
Narrow the cry and sectarian oft: true sons of their age;<br />
Justice avenged unjustly; yet more in sorrow than rage;<br />
Till they drank the poison of power, the Circ&eacute;-cup of command,<br />
And the face of Liberty fail&rsquo;d, and the sword was snatch&rsquo;d
from her hand.<br />
Now Law &rsquo;neath the scaffold cowers, and,&mdash;shame engendering
shame,&mdash;<br />
<!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>The
hell-pack of war is laid close on the land for ruin and flame.<br />
For as things most holy are worst, from holiness when they decline,<br />
So Law, in the name of law once outraged, demon-divine,<br />
Swoops back as Anarchy arm&rsquo;d, and maddens her lovers of yore,<br />
Changed from their former selves, and clothed in the chrisom of gore.<br />
Then Falkland and Hampden are gone; and darker counsels arise;<br />
Vane with his tortuous soul, through over-wisdom unwise;<br />
Pym, deep stately designer, the subtle in simple disguised,<br />
Artist in plots, projector of panics he used, and despised!<br />
&mdash;But as, in the mountain world, where the giants each lift up
their horn<br />
To the skies defiant and pale, and our littleness measure and scorn,<br />
Frowning-out from their far-off summits: and eye and mind may not know<br />
Which is hugest, where all are huge: But, as from the region we go<br />
Receding, the Titan of Titans comes forth, and above him the sky<br />
Is deepest: and lo!&mdash;&rsquo;tis the White One, the Monarch!&mdash;He
mounts, as we fly!<br />
Or as over the sea the gay ships and the dolphins glisten and flit,<br />
And then that Leviathan comes, and takes his pastime in it;<br />
And wherever he ploughs his dark road, they must sink or follow him
still,<br />
For his is the bulkiest strength, the proud and paramount will!<br />
&mdash;Thou wast great, O King! (for we grudge not the style thou didst
yearn-for in vain,<br />
But a river of blood was between and an ineffaceable stain),<br />
<!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>Great
with an earth-born greatness; a Titan of awe, not of love;<br />
&rsquo;Twas strength and subtlety balanced; the wisdom not from above.<br />
For he leant o&rsquo;er his own deep soul, oracular; over the pit<br />
As the Pythia throned her of old, where the rock in Delphi was split;<br />
And the vapour and echo within he mis-held for divine; and the land<br />
Heard and obey&rsquo;d, unwillingly willing, the voice of command.<br />
&mdash;Soaring enormous soul, that to height o&rsquo;er the highest
aspires;<br />
All that the man can seize being nought to what he desires!<br />
And as, in a palace nurtured, the child to courtesy grows,<br />
Becoming at last what it acts; so man on himself can impose,<br />
Drill and accustom himself to humility, till, like an art,<br />
The lesson the fingers have learn&rsquo;d appears the command of the
heart;<br />
Whilst pride, as the snake at the charmer&rsquo;s command, coils low
in its place,<br />
And he wears to himself and his fellows the mask that is almost a face.<br />
Truest of hypocrites, he!&mdash;in himself entangled, he thinks<br />
Earth uprising to Heaven, while earth-ward the heavenly sinks:<br />
Conscience, we grant it, his guide; but conscience drugg&rsquo;d and
deceived;<br />
Conscience which all that his self-belief whisper&rsquo;d as duty believed.<br />
And though he sought earnest for God, in life-long wrestle and prayer,<br />
Yet the sky by a veil was darken&rsquo;d, a phantom flitting in air;<br />
For a cloud from that seething cavernous heart fumed out in his youth,<br />
<!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>And
whatever he will&rsquo;d in the strength of the soul was imaged as truth:&mdash;<br />
Grew with his growth: And now &rsquo;tis Ambition, disguised in success;<br />
And he walks with the step assured, that cares not its issue to guess,<br />
Clear in immediate purpose: and moulding his party at will,<br />
He thrones it o&rsquo;er obstinate sects, his ideal constrain&rsquo;d
to fulfil.<br />
Cool in his very heat, self-master, he masters the realm:<br />
God and His glory the flag; but King Oliver lord of the helm!<br />
As he needs, steers crooked or straight: with his eye controlling the
proud,<br />
While blandness runs from his tongue, as the candidate fawns on the
crowd;<br />
Sagest of Titans, he stands; dark, ponderous, muddy-profound,<br />
Greatness untemper&rsquo;d, untuned; no song, but a chaos of sound:&mdash;<br />
Yet the key-note is ever beneath: &lsquo;Mere humble instruments!&nbsp;
See!<br />
Poor weak saints, at the best: but who has triumph&rsquo;d as we?&rsquo;<br />
Thanks the Lord for each massacre-mercy, His glory, for His is the Cause:<br />
Catlike he bridles, and purrs about God: but within are the claws,<br />
The lion-strength is within!&mdash;Vane, Ludlow, Hutchinson, knew,<br />
When the bauble of Law disappear&rsquo;d, and the sulky senate withdrew:<br />
When the tyrannous Ten sword-silenced the land, and the necks of the
strong<br />
By the heel of their great Dictator were bruised, wrong trampling on
wrong.<br />
<!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>Least
willing of despots! and fain the fair temple of Law to restore,<br />
Sheathing the sword in the sceptre: But lo! as in legends of yore,<br />
Once drawn, once redden&rsquo;d, it may not return to the scabbard!&mdash;and
straight<br />
On that iron-track&rsquo;d path he had framed to the end he is goaded
by Fate.<br />
And yet, as a temperate man, to flavour some exquisite dish,<br />
Without stint pours forth the red wine, thus only can compass his wish;<br />
Upon Erin the death-mark he brands, the Party and Cause to secure;<br />
Not bloodthirsty by birth; just, liquor &rsquo;twas needful to pour;<br />
Only the wine of man&rsquo;s blood! . . . But the horrible sacrament
thrill&rsquo;d<br />
Right through the heart of a nation; nor yet is the memory still&rsquo;d;<br />
E&rsquo;en yet the dim spectre returns, the ghost of the murderous years,<br />
Blood flushing out in hatred; or blood transmuted to tears!<br />
&mdash;Ah strange drama of Fate! what motley pageantries rise<br />
On the stage of this make-shift world! what irony silenced in sighs!<br />
For as when the Switzer looks down on the dell, from the pass and the
snow,<br />
Sees the peace of the fields, the white farms, the clear equable streamlet
below,<br />
And before him the world unknown, the blaze of the shadowless Line,<br />
Riches ill-purchased in exile, the toiling plantation and mine;<br />
And the horn floats up the faint music of youth from his forefathers&rsquo;
fold,<br />
And he sighs for the patient life, the peace more golden than gold:&mdash;<br />
<!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>So
He now looks back on the years, and groans &rsquo;neath the load he
must bear,<br />
Loving this England that loathed him, and none the burden to share!<br />
Gagging not gaining souls: to the close he wonders in vain<br />
Why he cannot win hearts: why &rsquo;tis only the will that resigns
to his reign.<br />
As that great image in Dura, the land perforce must obey,<br />
Unloved, unlovely,&mdash;and not the feet only of iron and clay,&mdash;<br />
Atlas of this wide realm! in himself he summ&rsquo;d up the whole;<br />
Its children the Cause had devour&rsquo;d: the sword was childless and
sole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Ah strange drama of Fate! what motley pageantries
rise<br />
On the stage of this make-shift world! what irony silenced in sighs!<br />
In the strait beneath Etna for as the waves ebb, and Scylla betrays<br />
The monster below, foul scales of the serpent and slime,&mdash;could
we gaze<br />
On Tyranny stript of her tinsel, what vision of dool and dismay!<br />
Terror in confidence clothed, and anarchy biding her day:<br />
Selfishness hero-mask&rsquo;d; stage-tricks of the shabby-sublime;<br />
Impotent gaspings at good; and the deluge after her time!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Is it war that thunders o&rsquo;er England,
and bursts the millennial oak<br />
From his base like a castle uprooted, and shears with impalpable stroke<br />
The sails from the ocean, the houses of men, while the Conqueror lay<br />
On the morn of his crowning mercy, and life flicker&rsquo;d down with
the day?<br />
Is it war on the earth, or war in the skies, or Nature who tolls<br />
<!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>Her
passing-bell as from earth they go up, her imperial souls?<br />
&mdash;He rests:&mdash;&rsquo;Tis a lion-sleep: and the sternness of
Truth is reproved:<br />
The sleep of a leader of men; unhuman, to watch him unmoved!<br />
In the stillness of pity and awe we remember his troublesome years,<br />
For man is the magnet to man, and mortal failure has tears.<br />
&mdash;He rests:&mdash;On the massive brows, as a rock by the sunrise
is crown&rsquo;d,<br />
His passionate love for the land, in a glory-coronal bound!<br />
And Mercy dawns fast o&rsquo;er the dead, from the bier as we turn and
depart,<br />
England for England&rsquo;s sake clasp&rsquo;d firm as a child to his
heart.<br />
&mdash;He rests:&mdash;And the storm-clouds have fled, and the sunshine
of Nature repress&rsquo;d<br />
Breaks o&rsquo;er the realm in smiles, and the land again has her rest.<br />
He rests: the great spirit is hid where from heaven the veil is unroll&rsquo;d,<br />
And justice merges in love, and the dross is purged from the gold.</p>
<p>The general point of view from which this subject is here approached
is given in the following passages:&mdash;&lsquo;The whole nation,&rsquo;
says Macaulay (1659), &lsquo;was sick of government by the sword, and
pined for government by the law.&rsquo;&nbsp; Hence, when Charles landed,
&lsquo;the cliffs of Dover were covered by thousands of gazers, among
whom scarcely one could be found who was not weeping with delight .
. . Every where flags were flying, bells and music sounding, wine and
ale flowing in rivers to the health of him whose return was the return
of peace, of law, and of freedom.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nor was this astonishing:
the name of the Commonwealth, a greater than Macaulay remarks, &lsquo;was
grown infinitely odious: it was associated with the tyranny of ten years,
the selfish rapacity of the Rump, the hypocritical despotism of Cromwell,
the arbitrary sequestrations of committee-men, the iniquitous decimations
of <!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>military
prefects, the sale of British citizens for slavery in the West Indies,
the blood of some shed on the scaffold without legal trial, . . . the
persecution of the Anglican Church, the bacchanalian rant of sectaries,
the morose preciseness of puritans . . . It is universally acknowledged
that no measure was ever more national, or has ever produced more testimonies
of public approbation, than the restoration of Charles II. . . . For
the late government, whether under the parliament or the protector,
had never obtained the sanction of popular consent, nor could have subsisted
for a day without the support of the army.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s return
seemed to the people the harbinger of a real liberty, instead of that
bastard Commonwealth which had insulted them with its name&rsquo; (Hallam:
<i>Const. Hist</i>. ch. x and xi).</p>
<p><i>Peace in her car</i>; It will be seen that the Rospigliosi <i>Aurora</i>,
Guido&rsquo;s one inspired work, has been here before the writer&rsquo;s
memory.</p>
<p><i>On thyself thrice turn</i>; The civil wars of the Barons, the
Roses, and the Commonwealth.</p>
<p><i>He saw not</i>; Ranke&rsquo;s dispassionate summary of the attempted
&lsquo;arrest of five members,&rsquo; which has been always held one
of the King&rsquo;s most arbitrary steps, as it was, perhaps, the most
fatal, illustrates the view here taken: &lsquo;The prerogative of the
Crown, <i>in the sense of the early kings</i>&rsquo; (unconditional
right of arrest, in cases of treason), &lsquo;and the privilege of Parliament,
<i>in the sense of coming times</i>, were directly contradictory to
each other&rsquo;: (viii: 10).</p>
<p><i>Till they drank the poison</i>; A sentence weighty with his judicial
force may be here quoted from Hallam:&mdash;&lsquo;The desire of obtaining
or retaining power, if it be ever sought as a means, is soon converted
into an end.&rsquo;&nbsp; The career of the Long Parliament supports
this judgment: of it &lsquo;it may be said, I think, with not greater
severity than truth, that scarce two or three public acts of justice,
humanity, or generosity, and very few of political wisdom and courage,
are recorded of them from their quarrel with the King to their expulsion
by Cromwell&rsquo;: (<i>Const. Hist</i>. ch. x: Part i).</p>
<p><i>The chrisom</i>; Name for the white cloth in which babes were
veiled immediately after Baptism.</p>
<p><i>Artist in plots</i>; See Ranke (viii: 5) for Pym&rsquo;s skilful
use of a supposed plot, (the main element in which was known by himself
to be untrue), in older to terrify the House and ensure the destruction
of Stafford; and Hallam (ch. ix).&mdash;Admiration of Pym may be taken
as a proof that a historian is ignorant of, or faithless to, the fundamental
principles of the Constitution:&mdash;as the worship of Cromwell is
decisive against any man&rsquo;s love of liberty, whatever his professions.</p>
<p><i>O King</i>; &lsquo;Cromwell, like so many other usurpers, felt
his position <!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>too
precarious, or his vanity ungratified, without the name which mankind
have agreed to worship.&rsquo;&nbsp; The conversations recorded by Whitelock
are conclusive on this point: &lsquo;and, though compelled to decline
the crown, he undoubtedly did not lose sight of the object for the short
remainder of his life&rsquo; (<i>Hallam</i>).</p>
<p><i>The sky by a veil</i>; See <i>Appendix</i> D.</p>
<p><i>And he walks</i>; &lsquo;He said on one occasion, <i>He goes furthest
who knows not whither he is going</i>&rsquo;: (Ranke: xii: 1).</p>
<p><i>Purrs about God</i>; Examples, (the tone of which justifies this
phrase, and might deserve a severer), may be found by the curious in
the frailties of poor human nature, <i>passim</i>, in Cromwell&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Letters and Speeches,&rsquo; for which, (although not always
edited with precise accuracy), we are indebted to Mr. T. Carlyle.&nbsp;
But the view which he takes of his &lsquo;hero,&rsquo; whether in regard
of many particular facts alleged or neglected, or of the general estimate
of Cromwell as a man,&mdash;as it appears to the author plainly untenable
in face of proved historical facts, is here rejected.</p>
<p>The familiar figure of the Tyrant, too long known to the world,&mdash;with
the iron, the clay, and the little gold often interfused also in the
statue,&mdash;has been always easily recognisable by unbiassed eyes
in Oliver Cromwell.&nbsp; His tyranny was substantially that of his
kind, before his time and since, in its actions, its spirit, its result.&nbsp;
Fanaticism and Paradox may come with their apparatus of rhetoric to
blur, as they whitewash, the lineaments of their idol.&nbsp; Such eulogists
may &lsquo;paint an inch thick&rsquo;: yet despots,&mdash;political,
military, ecclesiastical,&mdash;will never be permanently acknowledged
by the common sense of mankind as worthy the great name of Hero.</p>
<p><i>The tyrannous Ten</i>; The Major-Generals, originally ten, (but
the number varied), amongst whom, in 1655, the Commonwealth was divided.&nbsp;
They displayed &lsquo;a rapacity and oppression beyond their master&rsquo;s&rsquo;
(Hallam): a phrase amply supported by the hardly-impeachable evidence
of Ludlow.</p>
<p><i>The horrible sacrament</i>; See <i>Appendix</i> D.</p>
<p><i>Why he cannot win hearts</i>; &lsquo;In the ascent of this bold
usurper to greatness . . . he had encouraged the levellers and persecuted
them; he had flattered the Long Parliament and betrayed it; he had made
use of the sectaries to crush the Commonwealth; he had spurned the sectaries
in his last advance to power.&nbsp; These, with the Royalists and Presbyterians,
forming in effect the whole people . . . were the perpetual, irreconcilable
enemies of his administration&rsquo; (Hallam ch. x).</p>

of the <!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>Protector

<h3>THE POET&rsquo;S EUTHANASIA</h3>
<p>November: 1674</p>
<p>Cloked in gray threadbare poverty, and blind,<br />
Age-weak, and desolate, and beloved of God;<br />
High-heartedness to long repulse resign&rsquo;d,<br />
Yet bating not one jot of hope, he trod<br />
The sunless skyless streets he could not see;<br />
By those faint feet made sacrosanct to me.</p>
<p>Yet on that laureate brow the sign he wore<br />
Of Phoebus&rsquo; wrath; who,&mdash;for his favourite child,<br />
When war and faction raised their rancorous roar,<br />
Leagued with fanatic frenzy, blood-defiled,<br />
To the sweet Muses and himself untrue,&mdash;<br />
Around the head he loved thick darkness threw.</p>
<p>&mdash;He goes:&mdash;But with him glides the Pleiad throng<br />
Of that imperial line, whom Phoebus owns<br />
His ownest: for, since his, no later song<br />
Has soar&rsquo;d, as wide-wing&rsquo;d, to the diadem&rsquo;d thrones<br />
That, in their inmost heaven, the Muses high<br />
Set for the sons of immortality.</p>
<p>Most loved, most lovely, near him as he went,<br />
Vergil: and He, supremest for all time,<br />
In hoary blindness:&mdash;But the sweet lament<br />
Of Lesbian love, the Parian song sublime,<br />
Follow&rsquo;d:&mdash;and that stern Florentine apart<br />
Cowl&rsquo;d himself dark in thought, within his heart</p>
<p><!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>Nursing
the dream of Church and Caesar&rsquo;s State,<br />
Empire and Faith:&mdash;while Fancy&rsquo;s favourite child,<br />
The myriad-minded, moving up sedate<br />
Beckon&rsquo;d his countryman, and inly smiled:&mdash;<br />
Then that august Theophany paled from view,<br />
To higher stars drawn up, and kingdoms new.</p>
<p>The last ten years of Milton&rsquo;s life were passed at his house
situate in the (then) &lsquo;Artillery Walk,&rsquo; Bunhill, near Aldersgate.&nbsp;
He is described as a spare figure, of middle stature or a little less,
who walked, generally clothed in a gray camblet overcoat, in the streets
between Bunhill and Little Britain.</p>
<p><i>Vergil</i>; placed first as most like Milton in consummate art
and permanent exquisiteness of phrase.&nbsp; It is to him, also, (if
to any one), that Milton is metrically indebted.&mdash;The other poets
classed as &lsquo;Imperial&rsquo; are Homer, Sappho, Archilochus, Dante,
Shakespeare.&nbsp; The supremacy in rank which the writer has here ventured
to limit to these seven poets, (though with a strong feeling of diffidence
in view of certain other Hellenic and Roman claims), is assigned to
Sappho and Archilochus, less on account of the scanty fragments, though
they be &lsquo;more golden than gold,&rsquo; which have reached us,
than in confidence that the place collateral with Homer, given them
by their countrymen (who criticized as admirably as they created), was,
in fact, justified by their poetry.</p>
<p><i>The dream</i>; Dante&rsquo;s political wishes and speculations,
wholly opposed to Milton&rsquo;s, are, however, like his in their impracticable
originality.</p>

And picture-woven walls, and lamps that gleam&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unholy radiance, sate,<br />

Toy&rsquo;d, and the wine laugh&rsquo;d round, and music stream&rsquo;d<br />

<p>Lord Macaulay&rsquo;s lively description of this scene (<i>Hist</i>.

&lsquo;the King had complained that he did not feel well.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Tudor-Stuart</i>; This famous Gallery was of sixteenth-century
date.</p>
<p><i>When the heart</i>; The weariness of England under the triple
yoke of Puritanism, the Independents, and the Protector, has been already
noticed: (Note on p. 125).</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Restoration,&rsquo; says Professor Seeley, in an able
essay on current perversions of seventeenth-century-history, &lsquo;was
not a return to servitude, but the precise contrary.&nbsp; It was a
great emancipation, an exodus out of servitude into liberty . . . As
to the later Stuarts, I regard them as pupils of Cromwell: . . . it
was their great ambition to appropriate his methods,&rsquo; (and, we
may add, to follow his foreign policy in regard to France and Holland),
for the benefit of the old monarchy.&nbsp; They failed where their model
had succeeded, and the distinction of having enslaved England remained
peculiar to Cromwell.&rsquo;</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tall cuirassiers broke,<br />

<p>Monmouth&rsquo;s invasion forms one of the most brilliant,&mdash;perhaps
the most brilliant,&mdash;of Lord Macaulay&rsquo;s narratives.&nbsp;
But many curious details are added in the <i>History</i> by Mr. G Roberts
(1844).</p>
<p>The belief, which this poem represents, that &lsquo;King Monmouth,&rsquo;
as he was called in the West, would return, lasted long.&nbsp; He landed
in Lyme Bay, June 11, 1685, between the Cobb (Harbour-pier) and the
beginning of the Ware cliffs: marching north, after a few days, by the
road which left the ruins of Colway House on the right and led over
Uplyme to Axminster.</p>
<p><i>Soho</i>; the watch-word on Monmouth&rsquo;s side at Sedgemoor;
his London house was in the Fields, (now Square), bearing that name.</p>
<p><i>Faithful Taunton</i>; here the Puritan spirit was strong; and
here Monmouth was persuaded to take the title of king (June 20), symbolized
by the flag which the young girls of Taunton presented to him.&nbsp;
It bore a crown with the cypher J B.&mdash;Monmouth&rsquo;s own name
being James.</p>
<p><i>Dour deep trench</i>; Sedgemoor lies in a marshy district near
Bridgewater, much intersected by trenches or &lsquo;Rhines.&rsquo;&nbsp;
One, the Busses Rhine, lay between the two armies as they fought, July
6.&nbsp; Monmouth was caught hiding in Cranborne Chase, July 8; executed,
after a vain attempt to move the heart of his uncle the king, July 15,
on Tower Hill.</p>

he had was for Holland. . . . In the gallery of Whitehall he pined for
the familiar House in the Wood at the Hague, and never was so happy
as when he could quit the magnificence of Windsor for his humbler seat
at Loo:&rsquo; (Macaulay: <i>Hist</i>. ch. vii)</p>

between Anne and William III, influenced her to write to her Father,
&lsquo;supplicating his forgiveness, and professing repentance for the
part she had taken.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Now &rsquo;tis so</i>; Anne &lsquo;was said to attribute the death
of her children to the part she had taken in dethroning her father:&rsquo;
(Lecky, <i>History of the Eighteenth Century</i>).</p>
<p><i>The brother</i>; The infant son of James, known afterwards as
the &lsquo;Old Pretender,&rsquo; or as James III.&nbsp; He was carried
as an infant from the <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>Palace
(Dec. 1688) to Lambeth, where he was in great peril of discovery.&nbsp;
The story is picturesquely told by Macaulay.</p>
<p><i>One blossom</i>; The Duke of Gloucester, who grew up to eleven
years, dying in July 1700.&nbsp; After his death Anne signed, in private
letters, &lsquo;your unfortunate&rsquo; friend.</p>
<p>Anne&rsquo;s character, says the candid Lecky, &lsquo;though somewhat
peevish and very obstinate, was pure, generous, simple, and affectionate;
and she displayed, under bereavements far more numerous than fall to
the share of most, a touching piety that endeared her to her people.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Blenheim is fully described in Lord Stanhope&rsquo;s <i>Reign of
Queen Anne</i>.&nbsp; Its importance as a critical battle in European
history lies in the fact that the work of liberating the Great Alliance
against the paramount power of France under Lewis XIV, (which England
had unwisely fostered from Cromwell to James II), was secured by this
victory.&nbsp; &lsquo;The loss of France could not be measured by men
or fortresses.&nbsp; A <!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>hundred

flower of the French soldiery broke the spell&rsquo;: (Green: <i>History

<p>&lsquo;The French and Bavarians, who numbered, like their opponents,
some fifty thousand men, lay behind a little stream which ran through
swampy ground to the Danube . . . It was not till midday that Eugene,
who commanded on the right, succeeded in crossing the stream.&nbsp;
The English foot at once forded it on the left.&rsquo;&nbsp; They were

making an artificial road across the morass which covered it,&rsquo;
in two desperate charges turned the day.</p>

vast hillsides to the right of the Allies covered with wood.&nbsp; This
map also specifies the advance of the English in nine columns.</p>

&lsquo;was a humane and compassionate man.&nbsp; Even in the eagerness
to pursue fresh conquests he did not ever neglect the care of the wounded.&rsquo;</p>

Timoleon, who in Syracuse laid down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That gleaming bait of all men&rsquo;s eyes,<br />

Moving serenely through his grayhair&rsquo;d day<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Sad sunset of a royal race in gloom,<br />
Accomplishing to the end the dolorous Stuart doom!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghost of a king, he sate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Rome, the city of ghosts and thrones outworn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Drowsing his thoughts in wine;&mdash;a life forlorn;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pageant of faded state;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Aged before old age, and all that Past,<br />
Like a forgotten thing of shame, behind him cast.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet if by chance the cry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the sharp pibroch through the palace thrill&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He felt the pang of high hope unfulfill&rsquo;d:&mdash;<br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Triumphant in its pain:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the old days of Holyrood halls return&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The leaden lethargy from his soul he spurn&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And was the Prince again:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All Scotland waking in him; all her bold<br />
Chieftains and clans:&mdash;and all their tale, and his, he told:</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Told how, o&rsquo;er the

lay,<br />

<p>The sad old age of Prince Charles is described by Lord Mahon [Stanhope]
in his able <i>History</i>: ch. xxx: and some additional details will
be found in Chambers&rsquo; narrative of the expedition.&nbsp; During
later life, an almost entire silence seems to have been maintained by
the Prince upon his earlier days and his royal claims.&nbsp; But the
bagpipe was occasionally heard in the Roman Palace, and a casual visit,
which Lord Mahon fixes in 1785, drew forth the recital which is the
subject of this poem.&nbsp; The prince fainted as he recalled what his
Highland followers had gone through, and his daughter rushing in exclaimed
to the visitor, &lsquo;Sir! what is this!&nbsp; You must have been <!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>speaking
to my father about Scotland and the Highlanders!&nbsp; No one dares
to mention these subjects in his presence:&rsquo; (Mahon: ch. xxvi).</p>
<p>St. 2 <i>Drowsing His thoughts</i>; The habit of intemperance, common
in that century to many who had not Charles Edward&rsquo;s excuses,
appear to have been learned during the long privations which accompanied
his wanderings, between Culloden and his escape to France.</p>
<p>St. 5 <i>Hebrides</i>; Charles landed at Erisca, an islet between
Barra and South Uist, in July 1745.</p>
<p>St. 7 <i>Fettering Forth</i>; &lsquo;Forth,&rsquo; according to the
proverb, &lsquo;bridles the wild Highlandman.&rsquo;&mdash;Charles passed
it at the Ford of Frew, about eight miles above Stirling.&mdash;<i>At
Gladsmuir</i>; or Preston Pans; Sep. 21, 1745.&mdash;<i>White Horse</i>;
The armorial bearing of Hanover.</p>
<p>St. 8 <i>Clan Colla</i>; general name for the sept of the Macdonalds.</p>
<p>St. 10 <i>Caer Luel</i>; Urien ap Urbgen is an early hero of Strathclyde
or Alcluith, the British kingdom lying between Dumbarton and Carlisle,
then Caer Luel.</p>
<p>St. 12 <i>Ben Aille</i>; a mountain over Loch Ericht in the central
Highlands.</p>
<p>St. 13 <i>Ice-brook-temper&rsquo;d</i>; &lsquo;It is a sword of Spain,
the ice-brook&rsquo;s temper&rsquo;: (<i>Othello</i>: A. 5: S. 2).</p>
<p>St. 14 <i>At Falkirk</i>; Jan 17, 1746.&nbsp; &lsquo;On the eve after
his victory Charles again encamped on Bannockburn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>St. 16 <i>The mortal moor</i>; named Culloden and Drummossie: Ap.

<p>St. 21&nbsp; <i>Love&rsquo;s gentler judgment</i>; We may perhaps
quote on his behalf Vergil&rsquo;s beautiful words</p>
<blockquote><p>. . . utcumque ferent ea facta minores,<br />
Vincet amor patriae laudumque inmensa cupido.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;It is also pleasant to record that over the coffin of Charles
in S. Peter&rsquo;s, Rome, a monument was placed by George the Fourth,
upon which, by a graceful and gallant &lsquo;act of oblivion,&rsquo;
are inscribed the names of James the Third, Charles the Third, and Henry
the Ninth, &lsquo;Kings of England.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On the simple monument set up by his brother Henry in S. Pietro,
Frascati, it may be worth notice that Charles is only described as <i>Paterni
iuris et regiae</i> | <i>dignitatis successor et heres</i>:&mdash;the
title, King, (given to his Father in the inscription), not being assigned
to Charles, or assumed by the Cardinal.</p>

of France, and Gravina of Spain: so they shifted their ground,<br />
They could choose,&mdash;they were more than we;&mdash;and they faced
at Trafalgar round;<br />
Rampart-like ranged in line, a sea-fortress angrily tower&rsquo;d!<br />
In the midst, four-storied with guns, the dark <i>Trinidada</i> lower&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with those.&mdash;But meanwhile, as against
some dyke that men massively rear,<br />
From on high the torrent surges, to drive through the dyke as a spear,<br />
Eagled-eyed e&rsquo;en in his blindness, our chief sets his double array,<br />
Making the fleet two spears, to thrust at the foe, any way, . . .<br />
&lsquo;Anyhow!&mdash;without orders, each captain his Frenchman may
grapple perforce:<br />
Collingwood first&rsquo; (yet the <i>Victory</i> ne&rsquo;er a whit
slacken&rsquo;d her course)<br />
&lsquo;Signal for action!&nbsp; Farewell! we shall win, but we meet
not again!&rsquo;<br />
&mdash;Then a low thunder of readiness ran from the decks o&rsquo;er
the main,<br />
And on,&mdash;as the message from masthead to masthead flew out like
a flame,<br />
<span class="smcap">England expects every man will do his duty,&mdash;</span>they
came.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Silent they come:&mdash;While the thirty
black forts of the foeman&rsquo;s array<br />
Clothe them in billowy snow, tier speaking o&rsquo;er tier as they lay;<br />
Flashes that thrust and drew in, as swords when the battle is rife;&mdash;<br />
<!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>But
ours stood frowningly smiling, and ready for death as for life.<br />
&mdash;O in that interval grim, ere the furies of slaughter embrace,<br />
Thrills o&rsquo;er each man some far echo of England; some glance of
some face!<br />
&mdash;Faces gazing seaward through tears from the ocean-girt shore;<br />
Faces that ne&rsquo;er can be gazed on again till the death-pang is
o&rsquo;er. . . .<br />
Lone in his cabin the Admiral kneeling, and all his great heart<br />
As a child&rsquo;s to the mother, goes forth to the loved one, who bade
him depart<br />
. . . O not for death, but glory! her smile would welcome him home!<br />
&mdash;Louder and thicker the thunderbolts fall:&mdash;and silent they
come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when beyond Dongola the lion, whom hunters attack,<br />
Plagued by their darts from afar, leaps in, dividing them back;<br />
So between Spaniard and Frenchman the <i>Victory</i> wedged with a shout,<br />
Gun against gun; a cloud from her decks and lightning went out;<br />
Iron hailing of pitiless death from the sulphury smoke;<br />
Voices hoarse and parch&rsquo;d, and blood from invisible stroke.<br />
Each man stood to his work, though his mates fell smitten around,<br />
As an oak of the wood, while his fellow, flame-shatter&rsquo;d, besplinters
the ground:&mdash;<br />
Gluttons of danger for England, but sparing the foe as he lay;<br />
For the spirit of Nelson was on them, and each was Nelson that day.</p>

Save whom we can,<br />
Silence our guns&rsquo;:&mdash;for in him the woman was great in the
man,<br />
In that heroic heart each drop girl-gentle and pure,<br />
Dying by those he spared;&mdash;and now Death&rsquo;s triumph was sure!<br />
From the deck the smoke-wreath clear&rsquo;d, and the foe set his rifle
in rest,<br />
Dastardly aiming, where Nelson stood forth, with the stars on his breast,&mdash;<br />
&lsquo;In honour I gain&rsquo;d them, in honour I die with them&rsquo;
. . . Then, in his place,<br />
Fell . . . &lsquo;Hardy! &rsquo;tis over; but let them not know&rsquo;:
and he cover&rsquo;d his face.<br />
Silent, the whole fleet&rsquo;s darling they bore to the twilight below:<br />
And above the war-thunder came shouting, as foe struck his flag after
foe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his heart death rose: and for Hardy, the faithful,
he cried in his pain,&mdash;<br />
&lsquo;How goes the day with us, Hardy?&rsquo; . . . &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis
ours&rsquo;:&mdash;Then he knew, not in vain<br />
Not in vain for his comrades and England he bled: how he left her secure,<br />
Queen of her own blue seas, while his name and example endure.<br />
O, like a lover he loved her! for her as water he pours<br />
Life-blood and life and love, lavish&rsquo;d all for her sake, and for
ours!<br />
&mdash;&lsquo;Kiss me, Hardy!&mdash;Thank God!&mdash;I have done my
duty!&rsquo;&mdash;And then<br />
Fled that heroic soul, and left not his like among men.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; The nerves of war unstrung,<br />
Faint thoughts or rash alternate in her breast,</p>

He read the ground, and his stern squadrons moved<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And placed with artist-skill,<br />
Red counters in the perilous game they loved,</p>
<p>Impassive, iron, he and they!&mdash;and then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With eagle-keener ken<br />
Glanced through the field, the crisis-instant knew,<br />

<p>Among the many wonders of Wellington&rsquo;s Peninsular campaign,
from Vimiera (1808) to Toulouse (1814), the magnificent unity of scheme
preserved throughout is, perhaps, the most wonderful: the dramatic coherence,
development, and final catastrophe of triumph.&nbsp; For this, however,
readers must be referred to Napier&rsquo;s <i>History</i>; Enough here
to add that one of the most decisive steps was the formation of the
lines in defence of Lisbon, of which the most northerly ran from Alhandra
on the Tagus by Aruda and Zibreira to Torres Vedras near the sea-coast
at the mouth of the Zizandre.</p>
<p><i>When Freedom</i>; the unwise and uncertain management of the campaign
by the English home Government has been set forth by Napier with so
much emphasis as, in some degree, to impair the reader&rsquo;s full
conviction.&nbsp; Yet the amazing superiority in energy and wisdom with
which Wellington towered over his contemporaries, (the field being,
however, cleared by the recent deaths of Nelson and Pitt), is so patent,
that this attempt to do justice to his greatness is offered with hesitation
and apology.</p>

SOLDIERS&rsquo; BATTLE</h3>
<p>November 5: 1854</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the solid sombre mist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the drizzling dazzling shower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They may mass them as they list,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The gray-coat Russian power;<br />
They are fifties &rsquo;gainst our tens, they, and more!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And from the fortress-town<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In silent squadrons down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er the craggy mountain-crown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unseen, they pour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the meagre British line<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That northern ocean press&rsquo;d;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But we never knew how few<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were we who held the crest!<br />
While within the curtain-mist dark shadows loom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Making the gray more gray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the volley-flames betray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With one flash the long array:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, the gloom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our narrow line too wide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the narrow crest we stood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in pride we named it <i>Home</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As we sign&rsquo;d it with our blood.<br />
And we held-on all the morning, and the tide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of foes on that low dyke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Surged up, and fear&rsquo;d to strike,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or on the bayonet-spike<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flung them, and died.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was no covert, that,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Gainst the shrieking cannon-ball!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But the stout hearts of our men<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>Were
the bastion and the wall:&mdash;<br />
And their chiefs hardly needed give command;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For they tore through copse and gray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mist that before them lay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And each man fought, that day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For his own hand!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet should we not forget<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Gainst that dun sea of foes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How Egerton bank&rsquo;d his line,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till in front a cloud uprose<br />
From the level rifle-mouths; and they dived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With bayonet-thrust beneath;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Clench&rsquo;d teeth and sharp-drawn breath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Plunging to certain death,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet survived!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the gallant chief who led<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those others, how he fell;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When our men the captive guns<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Set free they loved so well,<br />
And embraced them as live things, by loss endear&rsquo;d:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor, when the crucial stroke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On their last asylum broke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And e&rsquo;en those hearts of oak<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Might well have fear&rsquo;d,&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How Stanley to the fore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The citadel rush&rsquo;d to guard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With that old Albuera cry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Fifty-seventh</i>!&nbsp; <i>Die hard</i>!<br />
Yet saw not how his lads clear the crest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, each one confronting five,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The stubborn squadrons rive,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And backward, downward, drive,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;Death-call&rsquo;d to rest!</p>

proud and sad for thee!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And proud and sad for those<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who on that stern foreign field<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not seeking, found repose,<br />
As for England dear their life they gladly shed!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet in death bethought them where,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not on these hillsides bare,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their own home-dead</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a green and sure repose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beside God&rsquo;s house are laid:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then faced the charging foes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unmoved, unhelp&rsquo;d, unafraid:&mdash;<br />
For they knew that God would rate each shatter&rsquo;d limb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Death-torn for England&rsquo;s sake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in Christ&rsquo;s own mercy take<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their souls to Him!</p>
<p>The battle of Inkermann was mainly fought on a ridge of rock which
projects from the south-eastern angle of Sebastapol: the English centre
of operations being the ill-fortified line named the &lsquo;Home Ridge.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The numbers engaged in field-operations, roughly speaking, were 4,000
English against 40,000 Russians.</p>
<p><i>The curtain-mist</i>; The battle began about 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.
</span>under heavy mist and drizzling rain, which lasted for several
hours.&nbsp; Through this curtain the Russian forces coming down from
the hill were seen only when near enough to darken the mist by their
masses.</p>
<p><i>Egerton</i>; He commanded four companies of the 77th, and charged
early in the battle with brilliant success;&mdash;his men, about 250,
scattering 1500 Russians.</p>
<p><i>The gallant chief</i>; General Soimonoff, killed just after Egerton&rsquo;s
charge.</p>
<p><i>With that old Albuera cry</i>; Prominent in the defence of the
English main base of operations, the Home Ridge, against a weighty Russian
advance, was Captain Stanley, commanding the 57th.&nbsp; This regiment,
it was said, at the battle of Albuera had been encouraged by its colonel
<!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>with
the words, &lsquo;Fifty-seventh, die hard&rsquo;:&mdash;and Stanley,
having less than 400 against 2000, thought the time had come to remind
his &lsquo;Die-hards&rsquo; of their traditional gallantry;&mdash;after
which he himself at once fell mortally wounded.</p>

<p>The English garrison at Cawnpore, with a large number of sick, women,
and children, were besieged in their hastily made and weak earthworks
by Nana Sahib from June 6 to June 25, 1857.&nbsp; Compelled to surrender,
under promise of safe convoy down the Ganges, on the 27th they were
massacred by musketry from the banks; the thatch of the river-boats
being also fired.&nbsp; The survivors were murdered and thrown into
the well upon Havelock&rsquo;s approach on July 15.</p>
<p>One boat managed to escape unburnt on June 27.&nbsp; It was chased
through the 28th and 29th, by which time the crowd on board was reduced
to fourteen men, one of whom, Mowbray-Thomson, has left a narrative
equally striking from its vividness and its modesty.&nbsp; Seven escaped

<h3>MOUNT VERNON</h3>
<p>October 5: 1860</p>
<p>Before the hero&rsquo;s grave he stood,<br />
&mdash;A simple stone of rest, and bare<br />
To all the blessing of the air,&mdash;<br />
And Peace came down in sunny flood<br />
From the blue haunts of heaven, and smiled<br />
Upon the household reconciled.</p>

hundred years have hardly flown<br />
Since in this hermitage of the West<br />
&rsquo;Mid happy toil and happy rest,<br />
Loving and loved among his own,<br />
His days fulfill&rsquo;d their fruitful round,<br />
Seeking no move than what they found.</p>
<p>Sweet byways of the life withdrawn!<br />
Yet here his country&rsquo;s voice,&mdash;the cry<br />
Of man for natural liberty,&mdash;<br />
That great Republic in her dawn,<br />
The immeasurable Future,&mdash;broke;<br />
And to his fate the Leader woke.</p>
<p>Not eager, yet, the blade to bare<br />
Before the Father-country&rsquo;s eyes,&mdash;<br />
&mdash;E&rsquo;en if a parent&rsquo;s rights, unwise,<br />
With that bold Son he grudged to share,<br />
In manhood strong beyond the sea,<br />
And ripe to wed with Liberty!</p>
<p>&mdash;Yet O! when once the die was thrown,<br />
With what unselfish patient skill,<br />
Clear-piercing flame of changeless will,<br />
The one high heart that moved alone<br />
Sedate through the chaotic strife,&mdash;<br />
He taught mankind the hero-life!</p>
<p>As when the God whom Pheidias moulds,<br />
Clothed in marmoreal calm divine,<br />
Veils all that strength &rsquo;neath beauty&rsquo;s line,<br />
All energy in repose enfolds;&mdash;<br />
So He, in self-effacement great,<br />
Magnanimous to endure and wait.</p>
<p>O Fabius of a wider world!<br />
Master of Fate through self-control<br />
And utter stainlessness of soul!<br />
<!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>And
when war&rsquo;s weary sign was furl&rsquo;d,<br />
Prompt with both hands to welcome in<br />
The white-wing&rsquo;d Peace he warr&rsquo;d to win!</p>
<p>Then, to that so long wish&rsquo;d repose!<br />
The liberal leisure of the farm,<br />
The garden joy, the wild-wood charm;<br />
Life ebbing to its perfect close<br />
Like some white altar-lamp that pales<br />
And self-consumed its light exhales.</p>
<p>No wrathful tempest smote its wing<br />
Against life&rsquo;s tender flickering flame;<br />
No tropic gloom in terror came;<br />
Slow waning as a summer-spring<br />
The soul breathed out herself, and slept,<br />
And to the end her beauty kept.</p>
<p>Then, as a mother&rsquo;s love and fears<br />
Throng round the child, unseen but felt,<br />
So by his couch his nation knelt,<br />
Loving and worshipping with her tears:&mdash;<br />
Tears!&mdash;late amends for all that debt<br />
Due to the Liberator yet!</p>
<p>For though the years their golden round<br />
O&rsquo;er all the lavish region roll,<br />
And realm on realm, from pole to pole,<br />
In one beneath thy stars be bound:<br />
The far-off centuries as they flow,<br />
No whiter name than this shall know!</p>
<p>&mdash;O larger England o&rsquo;er the wave,<br />
Larger, not greater, yet!&mdash;With joy<br />
Of generous hearts ye hail&rsquo;d the Boy<br />
Who bow&rsquo;d before the sacred grave,<br />
With Love&rsquo;s fair freight across the sea<br />
Sped from the Fatherland to thee!</p>

Freedom on that Empire-throne<br />
Blest in his Mother&rsquo;s rule revered,<br />

And rooted in the years unknown,&mdash;<br />
Land rich in old Experience&rsquo; store<br />
And holy legacies of yore,</p>

<p>The date prefixed is that of the visit which the Prince of Wales
paid to the tomb of Washington: carrying home thence, as one of the
most distinguished of his hosts said, &lsquo;an unwritten treaty of
amity and alliance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mount Vernon on the Potomac, named after the Admiral, was the family
seat of Augustine, father to George Washington, and the residence of
the latter from 1752.&nbsp; But all his early years also had been spent
in that neighbourhood, in those country pursuits which formed his ideal
of life: and thither, on resigning his commission as Commander-in-Chief,
he retired in 1785; devoting himself to farming and gardening with all
the strenuousness and devoted passion of a Roman of Vergil&rsquo;s type.&nbsp;
And there (Dec. 1799) was he buried.</p>
<p><i>Not eager</i>; When the ill-feeling between England and America
deepened after 1765, Washington &lsquo;was less eager than some others
in declaring or declaiming against the mother country;&rsquo; (Mahon:
<i>Hist</i>. ch. lii).</p>
<p><i>Ripe to wed with Liberty</i>; See <i>Appendix</i> G.</p>
<p><i>And to the end</i>; See Petrarch&rsquo;s beautiful lines: <i>Trionfo
della Morte</i>, cap. I.</p>
<p><i>Due to the Liberator</i>; Compare the epitaph by Ennius on Scipio:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hic est ille situs, cui nemo civi&rsquo; neque hostis<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Quivit pro factis reddere opis pretium.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>History, it may be said with reasonable confidence, records no hero
more unselfish, no one less stained with human error and frailty, than
George Washington.</p>
<p><i>The years unknown</i>; It is to Odin, whatever date be thereby
signified, that our royal genealogy runs back.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; The shadow of each perfect tree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By slanting shafts
of eve<br />
Flame-fringed and bathed in pale transparency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that long ridge that crowns the hill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stands fir-dark &rsquo;gainst the falling
rays;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above, a waft of pearly haze<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lies on the sapphire field of air,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So radiant and so still<br />
As though a star-cloud took its station there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up wold and wild the valley goes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Mid heath and mounded slopes of
oak,<br />

<h3>A: p. 87</h3>
<p><i>Till the terrible Day unreveal&rsquo;d</i>; Much of course is
and will probably remain unknown among the details of that fatal and
fascinating drama, Mary&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; But all hitherto ascertained
evidence has now, mainly by Mr. Hosack, been sifted so closely and so
ably that the main turning points in her career seem to have reached
that twilight certainty beyond which History can rarely hope to go,
and are placed beyond the reach of reasonable controversy.&nbsp; Such,
(not to enter upon the Queen&rsquo;s life as Elizabeth&rsquo;s captive),
is the more than Macchiavellian&mdash;the almost incredible&mdash;perfidy
of the leading Scottish politicians, united with a hypocrisy more revolting
still, and enabled to do its wicked work, (with regret we must confess),
by the shortsighted bigotry of Knox:&mdash;The gradual forgery of the
letters by which the Queen&rsquo;s death was finally obtained from the
too-willing hands of Elizabeth&rsquo;s Cabinet:&mdash;The all but legally
proved innocence of Mary in regard to Darnley&rsquo;s death, and the
Bothwell marriage.&nbsp; Taking her life as a whole, it may be fairly
doubted whether any woman has ever been exposed to trials and temptations
more severe, or has suffered more shamefully from false witness and
fanatical hatred.&nbsp; But the prejudices which have been hence aroused
are so strong, such great interests, religious and political, are involved
in their maintenance, that they will doubtless prevail in the popular
mind until our literature receives,&mdash;what an age of research and
of the scientific spirit should at last be prepared to give us,&mdash;a
tolerably truthful history of the Elizabethan period.&nbsp; (1889)</p>
<h3>B: p. 102</h3>
<p><i>Heroes both</i>;&mdash;<i>Each his side</i>;&mdash;In regard to
the main issue at stake in the Civil War, and the view taken of it throughout
this book, let me here once for all remark that no competent and impartial
student of our history can deny a fair cause to each side, whatever
errors may have been committed by Charles and by the Parliament, or
however fatal for some fifteen years to liberty and national happiness
were the excesses and the tyranny into which the victorious party gradually,
and as it were inevitably, drifted.&nbsp; &lsquo;No one,&rsquo; says
Ranke (whom I must often quote, because to this distinguished foreigner
we owe the single, though too brief, narrative of this period in which
history has been hitherto, treated historically, that is, without judging
of the events by the light either of their remote results, or of modern
political party), &lsquo;will make any very heavy political charge against
Strafford on the score of his government of Ireland, or of the partisan
attitude which he had taken up in the intestine struggle in England
in general; for the ideas for which he contended were as much to be
found in the past history of England as were those which he attacked:&rsquo;
<!-- page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>&mdash;and
Hampden&rsquo;s conduct may claim analogous justification.&nbsp; If
the Parliament could appeal to those mediaeval precedents which admitted
the right of the people through their representatives, to control taxation
and (more or less) direct national policy, Charles, (and Strafford with
him), might as lawfully affirm that they too were standing &lsquo;on
the ancient ways&rsquo;; on the royal supremacy undeniably exercised
by Henry II or Edward I. by Henry VIII and by Elizabeth.&nbsp; Both
parties could equally put forward the prosperity of England under these
opposed modes of government: Patriotism, honour, conscience, were watchwords
which either might use with truth or abuse with profit.&nbsp; If the
great struggle be patiently studied, the moral praise and censure so
freely given, according to a reader&rsquo;s personal bias, will be found
very rarely justified.&nbsp; There was far, very far, less of tyranny
or of liberty involved in the contest, up to 1642, than partisans aver.&nbsp;
To the actual actors (nor, as retrospectively criticized by us) it is
a fair battle on both sides, not a contest &lsquo;between light and
darkness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We, looking back after two centuries, are of course free to recognize,
that one effect of the Tudor despotism had been to train Englishmen
towards ruling themselves;&mdash;we may agree that the time had come
for Lords and Commons to take their part in the Kingdom.&nbsp; But no
proof, I think it may be said, can be shown that this great idea, in
any conscious sense, governed the Parliaments of James and Charles.&nbsp;
It is we who,&mdash;reviewing our history since the definite establishment
of the constitutional balance after 1688, and the many blessings the
land has enjoyed,&mdash;can perceive what in the seventeenth century
was wholly hidden from Commonwealth and from King.&nbsp; And even if
in accordance with the common belief, we ascribe English freedom and
prosperity and good government to the final triumph of the popular side,
yet deeper consideration should suggest that such retrospective judgments
are always inevitably made under our human entire ignorance what might
have been the result had the opposite party prevailed.&nbsp; Who should
say how often, in case of these long and wide extended struggles,&mdash;political
and dynastic,&mdash;the effects which we confidently claim as <i>propter
hoc</i>, are only <i>post hoc</i> in the last reality?</p>
<p>Waiving however these somewhat remote and what many will judge over-sceptical
considerations, this is certain, that unless we can purify our judgment
from reading into the history of the past the long results of time;&mdash;from
ascribing to the men of the seventeenth century prophetic insight into
the nineteenth;&mdash;unless, in short, we can free ourselves from the
chain of present or personal prepossessions;&mdash;no approach can be
made to a fair or philosophical judgment upon such periods of strife
and crisis as our Civil War preeminently offers.</p>
<h3>C: p. 108</h3>
<p><i>With glory he gilt</i>; Yet to readers, (if such readers there
be) who can look with an undazzled eye on military success, or hear
the still small voice of truth through the tempest of rhetoric, Cromwell&rsquo;s
foreign policy, (excepting the isolated case of his interference with
the then comparatively feeble powers of Savoy and the Papacy on behalf
of the persecuted Waldenses), will be far from supporting the credit
with which politico-theological partisanship has invested it.</p>
<p>Holland was beyond question the natural ally on political and religious
grounds of puritan England.&nbsp; But a mischievous war against her
in 1652-3 was caused by the arrogant restrictions of the Navigation
<!-- page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>Act
of 1651.&nbsp; The successful English demand in 1653 that the Orange
family, as connected closely with that of Stuart, should be excluded
from the Stadtholdership, was in a high degree to the prejudice of the
United Provinces.</p>
<p>In 1654 Cromwell was negotiating with France and Spain.&nbsp; From
the latter he arrogantly asked wholly unreasonable terms, whilst Mazarin,
on the part of France, offered Dunkirk as a bribe.&nbsp; News opportunely
arriving that certain Spanish possessions in America were feebly armed,
Cromwell at once declared war: and now, supplementing unscrupulous policy
by false theology, announced &lsquo;the Spaniards to be the natural
and ordained enemies of England, whom to fight was a duty both to country
and to religion:&rsquo; (Ranke: xii. 6).</p>
<p>The piratical war which followed, in many ways similar to that which
the &lsquo;wise Walpole&rsquo; tried to avert in 1739, was hardly less
impolitic than immoral.&nbsp; It alienated Holland, it sanctioned French
aggression on Flanders (xii. 7), it ended by giving Mazarin and Lewis
XIV that supremacy in Western Europe for which England had to pay in
the wars of William III and Anne; whilst, as soon as it was over, France
naturally allied herself with Spain, on a basis which might have caused
the union of the two crowns (xii. 8) and which allowed Spain at once
to support Charles II.&nbsp; As the result of the Protector&rsquo;s
&lsquo;spirited policy&rsquo; England thus figured as the catspaw of
France, and the enemy of European liberty.</p>
<p>It is satisfactory, however, to find that, in Ranke&rsquo;s judgment,
the common modern opinion that Cromwell&rsquo;s despotism was favourably
regarded in England because of his foreign enterprize, is exaggerated.&nbsp;
Even against the conquest of Jamaica,&mdash;his single signal gain,&mdash;unanswerable
arguments were popularly urged at the time: (xii. 4, 8)&mdash;But the
Protectorate, in the light of modern research,&mdash;like the reign
of Elizabeth,&mdash;still awaits its historian.</p>
<h3>D: p. 127</h3>
<p><i>The sky by a veil</i>; &lsquo;A spiritual world,&rsquo; says a
critic of deep insight, &lsquo;over and above this invisible one, is
a most important addition to our idea of the universe; but it does not
of itself touch our moral nature. . . . Its moral effect depends entirely
upon what we make that world to be.&rsquo;&mdash;Cromwell&rsquo;s religion,
which may be profitably studied in his letters and speeches, (much better
known of, than read) reveals itself there as the simple reflex of his
personal views: it had great power to animate, little or none to regulate
or control his impulses.&nbsp; He had, indeed, a most real and pervading
&lsquo;natural turn for the invisible; he thought of the invisible till
he died; but the cloudy arch only canopied a field of human aim and
will.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>The horrible sacrament</i>; The summary of Cromwell&rsquo;s conduct
at Drogheda by a writer of so much research, impartiality, and philosophic
liberality as Mr. Lecky deserves to be well considered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The sieges of Drogheda and Wexford, and the massacres that
accompanied them, deserve to rank in horror with the most atrocious
exploits of Tilly and Wallenstein, and they made the name of Cromwell
eternally hated in Ireland.&nbsp; It even now acts as a spell upon the
Irish mind, and has a powerful and living influence in sustaining the
hatred both of England and Protestantism.&nbsp; The massacre of Drogheda
acquired a deeper horror and a special significance from the saintly
professions and the religious phraseology of its perpetrators, and the
town <!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>where
it took place is, to the present day, distinguished in Ireland for the
vehemence of its Catholicism:&rsquo; (<i>Hist. of Eighteenth Cent</i>.
ch. vi).</p>
<p><i>Mortal failure</i>; The ever-increasing unsuccess of Cromwell&rsquo;s
career is forcibly set forth by Ranke (xii. 8).&nbsp; He had &lsquo;crushed
every enemy,&mdash;the Scottish and the Presbyterian system, the peers
and the king, the Long Parliament and the Cavalier insurgents,&mdash;but
to create . . . an organization consistent with the authority which
had fallen to his own lot, was beyond his power.&nbsp; Even among his
old&rsquo; Anabaptist and Independent &lsquo;friends, his comrades in
the field, his colleagues in the establishment of the Commonwealth,
he encountered the most obstinate resistance. . . . At no time were
the prisons fuller; the number of political prisoners was estimated
at 12,000 . . . The failure of his plans soured and distracted him.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It was, in fact, wholly &lsquo;beyond his power to consolidate a tolerably
durable political constitution.&rsquo;&mdash;To the disquiet caused
by constant attempts against Cromwell&rsquo;s life, Ranke adds the death
of his favourite daughter, Lady Claypole, whose last words of agony
&lsquo;were of the right of the king, the blood that had been shed,
the revenge to come.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>E: p. 146</h3>
<p><i>Unheirlike heir</i>; Richard Cromwell has received double measure
of that censure which the world&rsquo;s judgment too readily gives to
unsuccess, finding favour neither from Royalists nor Cromwellians.&nbsp;
Macaulay, with more justice, remarks, &lsquo;That he was a good man
he evinced by proofs more satisfactory than deep groans or long sermons,
by humility and suavity when he was at the height of human greatness,
and by cheerful resignation under cruel wrongs and misfortunes.&rsquo;
. . . &lsquo;He did nothing amiss during his short administration.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His fall may be traced to several causes: to the fact that the puritan
party proper, who supported him, the &lsquo;sober men&rsquo; mentioned
by Baxter &lsquo;that called his father no better than a traitorous
hypocrite,&rsquo; had not power to resist the fanatic cabal of army
chiefs: to the necessity he was under of protecting some justly-odious
confederates of Oliver: his own want of ability or energy to govern,&mdash;a
point fully recognized during Oliver&rsquo;s supremacy; and to his own
honourable decision not to &lsquo;have a drop of blood shed on his poor
account.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet there is ample evidence to show that Richard,
had he chosen, might have made a struggle to retain the throne,&mdash;sufficient,
at least, to have thus deluged the kingdom.</p>
<p>Richard&rsquo;s life was passed in great quiet after 1660: Charles
II, according to Clarendon, with a wise and humorous lenity, not thinking
it &lsquo;necessary to inquire after a man so long forgotten.&rsquo;&nbsp;
His letters reveal a man of affectionate and honest disposition; he
uses the Puritan phraseology of the day without leaving a sense of nausea
in the reader&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; At Hursley he was buried at a good
old age in 1712.</p>
<h3>F: p. 152</h3>
<p><i>A nation&rsquo;s craven rage</i>; The want of public spirit in
England shown during the war of 1745-6 is astonishing.&nbsp; &lsquo;England,&rsquo;
wrote Henry Fox, &lsquo;is for the first comer . . . Had 5,000 [French
troops] landed in any part of this island a week ago, I verily believe
the entire conquest of it would not have cost them a battle.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And other weighty testimonies might be added, in support of Lord Mahon&rsquo;s
view as to the great <!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>probability
of the Prince&rsquo;s success, had he been allowed by his followers
to march upon London from Derby.</p>
<p>This apathy and the panic which followed found their natural issue
in the sanguinary punishment of the followers of Prince Charles.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The city and the generality,&rsquo; wrote H. Walpole in August,
1746, &lsquo;are very angry that so many rebels have been pardoned.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The vindictive cruelty then shown makes, in truth (if we compare the
magnitude and duration of the rebellion for which punishment was to
be exacted), an unsatisfactory contrast to the leniency of 1660.&nbsp;
But History supplies only too numerous proofs that a century&rsquo;s
march in civilisation may be always undone at once by the demons of
Panic or of Party in the hour of their respective triumphs.</p>
<h3>G: p. 169</h3>
<p><i>Ripe to wed with Liberty</i>; Looking at the American War of Independence
without party-passion and distortion, as should now at least be possible
to Englishmen, the main cause must be acknowledged to lie simply in
the growth and geographical position of the Colonies, which had brought
them to the age of natural liberty, and had begun to fit them for its
exercise:&mdash;facts which it was equally in accordance with nature
that the Fatherland should fail to perceive.&nbsp; For the causes which
gradually determined American resistance we must look, (as regards us),
not to the blundering English legislation after 1760,&mdash;to the formalism
of Grenville, the subterfuges of Franklin,&mdash;but to the whole course
of our commercial policy since the Revolution: As regards the Colonies,
to the extinction of the power of France in America by the Treaty of
Paris in 1763: (Lecky: ch. v; Mahon: ch. xliii).</p>
<p>The Stamp Act of 1765 brought home, indeed, to a rapidly-developing
people the supremacy claimed across the Atlantic; but the obnoxious
taxation which it imposed, (despite the splendid sophistry of Chatham),
cannot be shown to differ essentially from the trade restrictions and
monopolies enacted in long series after 1688, as the result of the predominance
obtained at the Revolution by the commercial classes in this country,
and which so far as 1765 the colonies openly recognized as legal.</p>
<p>Going, however, beyond these minor motives, the true cause was unquestionably
that the time for separate life, for America to be herself, had come.&nbsp;
This was a crisis which home-legislation could do little to create or
to avert: a natural law, which only worked itself out ostensibly by
political man&oelig;uvres and military operations, so ill-managed as
to be rarely creditable to either side;&mdash;and, regarded simply as
a &lsquo;struggle for existence,&rsquo; is, in the eye of impartial
history, hardly within the scope of praise or censure.</p>
<p>But it was a neutrally tinted background like this, which could most
effectually bring into full relief the great qualities of the one great
man who was prominent in the conflict.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
